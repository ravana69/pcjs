 * In the compiled case, we rely on the Closure Compiler to override DEBUG, setting it to false,
 * so that all DEBUG-only code will be removed by the compiler.
 *
 * However, when we're in "development mode" and want to run uncompiled code without any DEBUG-only
 * code, we must arrange for this additional file (nodebug.js) to be loaded immediately after defines.js,
 * which will then set DEBUG to false at runtime.
