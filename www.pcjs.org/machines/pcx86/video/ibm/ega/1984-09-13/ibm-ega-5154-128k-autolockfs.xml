		If [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_Graphics_Adapter) is correct that the IBM EGA
		(presumably when paired with an IBM 5154 EGA monitor) has a "pixel aspect ratio" of 1:1.37 at its highest
		resolution (640x350), that suggests we should "stretch" our screen size vertically to 350 * 1.37, or 640x480
		(or something proportional, like 1280x960), assuming the native display has a "pixel aspect ratio" of 1:1.
		But testing reveals that round images appear roundest when we stick with a screen size proportional to 640x350.
		Also note that 1280x700 produces crisper results than 640x350, and 2560x1400 is sharper still (at least when
		using Chrome).  I'm going to split the difference and go with 1280x700.
