────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Introduction

    Advanced MS-DOS Programming is written for the experienced C or
    assembly-language programmer. It provides all the information you need to
    write robust, high-performance applications under the MS-DOS operating
    system. Because I believe that working, well-documented programs are
    unbeatable learning tools, I have included detailed programming examples
    throughout──including complete utility programs that you can adapt to your
    own needs.

    This book is both a tutorial and a reference and is divided into four
    sections, so that you can find information more easily. Section 1
    discusses MS-DOS capabilities and services by functional group in the
    context of common programming issues, such as user input, control of the
    display, memory management, and file handling. Special classes of
    programs, such as interrupt handlers, device drivers, and filters, have
    their own chapters.

    Section 2 provides a complete reference guide to MS-DOS function calls,
    organized so that you can see the calling sequence, results, and version
    dependencies of each function at a glance. I have also included notes,
    where relevant, about quirks and special uses of functions as well as
    cross-references to related functions. An assembly-language example is
    included for each entry in Section 2.

    Sections 3 and 4 are references to IBM ROM BIOS, Microsoft Mouse driver,
    and Lotus/Intel/Microsoft Expanded Memory Specification functions. The
    entries in these two sections have the same form as in Section 2, except
    that individual programming examples have been omitted.

    The programs in this book were written with the marvelous Brief editor
    from Solution Systems and assembled or compiled with Microsoft Macro
    Assembler version 5.1 and Microsoft C Compiler version 5.1. They have been
    tested under MS-DOS versions 2.1, 3.1, 3.3, and 4.0 on an 8088-based IBM
    PC, an 80286-based IBM PC/AT, and an 80386-based IBM PS/2 Model 80. As far
    as I am aware, they do not contain any software or hardware dependencies
    that will prevent them from running properly on any IBM PC─compatible
    machine running MS-DOS version 2.0 or later.

Changes from the First Edition

    Readers who are familiar with the first edition will find many changes in
    the second edition, but the general structure of the book remains the
    same. Most of the material comparing MS-DOS to CP/M and UNIX/XENIX has
    been removed; although these comparisons were helpful a few years ago,
    MS-DOS has become its own universe and deserves to be considered on its
    own terms.

    The previously monolithic chapter on character devices has been broken
    into three more manageable chapters focusing on the keyboard and mouse,
    the display, and the serial port and printer. Hardware-dependent video
    techniques have been de-emphasized; although this topic is more important
    than ever, it has grown so complex that it requires a book of its own. A
    new chapter discusses compatibility and portability of MS-DOS applications
    and also contains a brief introduction to Microsoft OS/2, the new
    multitasking, protected-mode operating system.

    A road map to vital figures and tables has been added, following the Table
    of Contents, to help you quickly locate the layouts of the program segment
    prefix, file control block, and the like.

    The reference sections at the back of the book have been extensively
    updated and enlarged and are now complete through MS-DOS version 4.0, the
    IBM PS/2 Model 80 ROM BIOS and the VGA video adapter, the Microsoft Mouse
    driver version 6.0, and the Lotus/Intel/Microsoft Expanded Memory
    Specification version 4.0.

    In the two years since Advanced MS-DOS Programming was first published,
    hundreds of readers have been kind enough to send me their comments, and I
    have tried to incorporate many of their suggestions in this new edition.

SECTION 1  PROGRAMMING FOR MS-DOS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────



────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Chapter 1  Genealogy of MS-DOS

    In only seven years, MS-DOS has evolved from a simple program loader into
    a sophisticated, stable operating system for personal computers that are
    based on the Intel 8086 family of microprocessors (Figure 1-1). MS-DOS
    supports networking, graphical user interfaces, and storage devices of
    every description; it serves as the platform for thousands of application
    programs; and it has over 10 million licensed users──dwarfing the combined
    user bases of all of its competitors.

    The progenitor of MS-DOS was an operating system called 86-DOS, which was
    written by Tim Paterson for Seattle Computer Products in mid-1980. At that
    time, Digital Research's CP/M-80 was the operating system most commonly
    used on microcomputers based on the Intel 8080 and Zilog Z-80
    microprocessors, and a wide range of application software (word
    processors, database managers, and so forth) was available for use with
    CP/M-80.

    To ease the process of porting 8-bit CP/M-80 applications into the new
    16-bit environment, 86-DOS was originally designed to mimic CP/M-80 in
    both available functions and style of operation. Consequently, the
    structures of 86-DOS's file control blocks, program segment prefixes, and
    executable files were nearly identical to those of CP/M-80. Existing
    CP/M-80 programs could be converted mechanically (by processing their
    source-code files through a special translator program) and, after
    conversion, would run under 86-DOS either immediately or with very little
    hand editing.

    Because 86-DOS was marketed as a proprietary operating system for Seattle
    Computer Products' line of S-100 bus, 8086-based microcomputers, it made
    very little impact on the microcomputer world in general. Other vendors of
    8086-based microcomputers were understandably reluctant to adopt a
    competitor's operating system and continued to wait impatiently for the
    release of Digital Research's CP/M-86.

    In October 1980, IBM approached the major microcomputer-software houses in
    search of an operating system for the new line of personal computers it
    was designing. Microsoft had no operating system of its own to offer
    (other than a stand-alone version of Microsoft BASIC) but paid a fee to
    Seattle Computer Products for the right to sell Paterson's 86-DOS. (At
    that time, Seattle Computer Products received a license to use and sell
    Microsoft's languages and all 8086 versions of Microsoft's operating
    system.) In July 1981, Microsoft purchased all rights to 86-DOS, made
    substantial alterations to it, and renamed it MS-DOS. When the first IBM
    PC was released in the fall of 1981, IBM offered MS-DOS (referred to as
    PC-DOS 1.0) as its primary operating system.

    IBM also selected Digital Research's CP/M-86 and Softech's P-system as
    alternative operating systems for the PC. However, they were both very
    slow to appear at IBM PC dealers and suffered the additional disadvantages
    of higher prices and lack of available programming languages. IBM threw
    its considerable weight behind PC-DOS by releasing all the IBM-logo PC
    application software and development tools to run under it. Consequently,
    most third-party software developers targeted their products for PC-DOS
    from the start, and CP/M-86 and P-system never became significant factors
    in the IBM PC─compatible market.

    In spite of some superficial similarities to its ancestor CP/M-80, MS-DOS
    version 1.0 contained a number of improvements over CP/M-80, including the
    following:

    ■  An improved disk-directory structure that included information about a
        file's attributes (such as whether it was a system or a hidden file),
        its exact size in bytes, and the date that the file was created or last
        modified

    ■  A superior disk-space allocation and management method, allowing
        extremely fast sequential or random record access and program loading

    ■  An expanded set of operating-system services, including
        hardware-independent function calls to set or read the date and time, a
        filename parser, multiple-block record I/O, and variable record sizes

    ■  An AUTOEXEC.BAT batch file to perform a user-defined series of commands
        when the system was started or reset

    IBM was the only major computer manufacturer (sometimes referred to as
    OEM, for original equipment manufacturer) to ship MS-DOS version 1.0 (as
    PC-DOS 1.0) with its products. MS-DOS version 1.25 (equivalent to IBM
    PC-DOS 1.1) was released in June 1982 to fix a number of bugs and also to
    support double-sided disks and improved hardware independence in the DOS
    kernel. This version was shipped by several vendors besides IBM, including
    Texas Instruments, COMPAQ, and Columbia, who all entered the personal
    computer market early. Due to rapid decreases in the prices of RAM and
    fixed disks, MS-DOS version 1 is no longer in common use.

    MS-DOS version 2.0 (equivalent to PC-DOS 2.0) was first released in March
    1983. It was, in retrospect, a new operating system (though great care was
    taken to maintain compatibility with MS-DOS version 1). It contained many
    significant innovations and enhanced features, including those listed on
    the following page.

    ■  Support for both larger-capacity floppy disks and hard disks

    ■  Many UNIX/XENIX-like features, including a hierarchical file structure,
        file handles, I/O redirection, pipes, and filters

    ■  Background printing (print spooling)

    ■  Volume labels, plus additional file attributes

    ■  Installable device drivers

    ■  A user-customizable system-configuration file that controlled the
        loading of additional device drivers, the number of system disk
        buffers, and so forth

    ■  Maintenance of environment blocks that could be used to pass
        information between programs

    ■  An optional ANSI display driver that allowed programs to position the
        cursor and control display characteristics in a hardware-independent
        manner

    ■  Support for the dynamic allocation, modification, and release of memory
        by application programs

    ■  Support for customized user command interpreters (shells)

    ■  System tables to assist application software in modifying its currency,
        time, and date formats (known as international support)

    MS-DOS version 2.11 was subsequently released to improve international
    support (table-driven currency symbols, date formats, decimal-point
    symbols, currency separators, and so forth), to add support for 16-bit
    Kanji characters throughout, and to fix a few minor bugs. Version 2.11
    rapidly became the base version shipped for 8086/8088-based personal
    computers by every major OEM, including Hewlett-Packard, Wang, Digital
    Equipment Corporation, Texas Instruments, COMPAQ, and Tandy.

    MS-DOS version 2.25, released in October 1985, was distributed in the Far
    East but was never shipped by OEMs in the United States and Europe. In
    this version, the international support for Japanese and Korean character
    sets was extended even further, additional bugs were repaired, and many of
    the system utilities were made compatible with MS-DOS version 3.0.

    MS-DOS version 3.0 was introduced by IBM in August 1984 with the release
    of the 80286-based PC/AT machines. It represented another major rewrite of
    the entire operating system and included the important new features listed
    on the following page.

    ■  Direct control of the print spooler by application software

    ■  Further expansion of international support for currency formats

    ■  Extended error reporting, including a code that suggests a recovery
        strategy to the application program

    ■  Support for file and record locking and sharing

    ■  Support for larger fixed disks

    MS-DOS version 3.1, which was released in November 1984, added support for
    the sharing of files and printers across a network. Beginning with version
    3.1, a new operating-system module called the redirector intercepts an
    application program's requests for I/O and filters out the requests that
    are directed to network devices, passing these requests to another machine
    for processing.

    Since version 3.1, the changes to MS-DOS have been evolutionary rather
    than revolutionary. Version 3.2, which appeared in 1986, generalized the
    definition of device drivers so that new media types (such as 3.5-inch
    floppy disks) could be supported more easily. Version 3.3 was released in
    1987, concurrently with the new IBM line of PS/2 personal computers, and
    drastically expanded MS-DOS's multilanguage support for keyboard mappings,
    printer character sets, and display fonts. Version 4.0, delivered in 1988,
    was enhanced with a visual shell as well as support for very large file
    systems.

    While MS-DOS has been evolving, Microsoft has also put intense efforts
    into the areas of user interfaces and multitasking operating systems.
    Microsoft Windows, first shipped in 1985, provides a multitasking,
    graphical user "desktop" for MS-DOS systems. Windows has won widespread
    support among developers of complex graphics applications such as desktop
    publishing and computer-aided design because it allows their programs to
    take full advantage of whatever output devices are available without
    introducing any hardware dependence.

    Microsoft Operating System/2 (MS OS/2), released in 1987, represents a new
    standard for application developers: a protected-mode, multitasking,
    virtual-memory system specifically designed for applications requiring
    high-performance graphics, networking, and interprocess communications.
    Although MS OS/2 is a new product and is not a derivative of MS-DOS, its
    user interface and file system are compatible with MS-DOS and Microsoft
    Windows, and it offers the ability to run one real-mode (MS-DOS)
    application alongside MS OS/2 protected-mode applications. This
    compatibility allows users to move between the MS-DOS and OS/2
    environments with a minimum of difficulty.

    Figure 1-1.  The evolution of MS-DOS.

    What does the future hold for MS-DOS? Only the long-range planning teams
    at Microsoft and IBM know for sure. But it seems safe to assume that
    MS-DOS, with its relatively small memory requirements, adaptability to
    diverse hardware configurations, and enormous base of users, will remain
    important to programmers and software publishers for years to come.

Chapter 2  MS-DOS in Operation

    It is unlikely that you will ever be called upon to configure the MS-DOS
    software for a new model of computer. Still, an acquaintance with the
    general structure of MS-DOS can often be very helpful in understanding the
    behavior of the system as a whole. In this chapter, we will discuss how
    MS-DOS is organized and how it is loaded into memory when the computer is
    turned on.


The Structure of MS-DOS

    MS-DOS is partitioned into several layers that serve to isolate the kernel
    logic of the operating system, and the user's perception of the system,
    from the hardware it is running on. These layers are

    ■  The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)

    ■  The DOS kernel

    ■  The command processor (shell)

    We'll discuss the functions of each of these layers separately.

The BIOS Module

    The BIOS is specific to the individual computer system and is provided by
    the manufacturer of the system. It contains the default resident
    hardware-dependent drivers for the following devices:

    ■  Console display and keyboard (CON)

    ■  Line printer (PRN)

    ■  Auxiliary device (AUX)

    ■  Date and time (CLOCK$)

    ■  Boot disk device (block device)

    The MS-DOS kernel communicates with these device drivers through I/O
    request packets; the drivers then translate these requests into the proper
    commands for the various hardware controllers. In many MS-DOS systems,
    including the IBM PC, the most primitive parts of the hardware drivers are
    located in read-only memory (ROM) so that they can be used by stand-alone
    applications, diagnostics, and the system startup program.

    The terms resident and installable are used to distinguish between the
    drivers built into the BIOS and the drivers installed during system
    initialization by DEVICE commands in the CONFIG.SYS file. (Installable
    drivers will be discussed in more detail later in this chapter and in
    Chapter 14.)

    The BIOS is read into random-access memory (RAM) during system
    initialization as part of a file named IO.SYS. (In PC-DOS, the file is
    called IBMBIO.COM.) This file is marked with the special attributes hidden
    and system.

The DOS Kernel

    The DOS kernel implements MS-DOS as it is seen by application programs.
    The kernel is a proprietary program supplied by Microsoft Corporation and
    provides a collection of hardware-independent services called system
    functions. These functions include the following:

    ■  File and record management

    ■  Memory management

    ■  Character-device input/output

    ■  Spawning of other programs

    ■  Access to the real-time clock

    Programs can access system functions by loading registers with
    function-specific parameters and then transferring to the operating system
    by means of a software interrupt.

    The DOS kernel is read into memory during system initialization from the
    MSDOS.SYS file on the boot disk. (The file is called IBMDOS.COM in
    PC-DOS.) This file is marked with the attributes hidden and system.

The Command Processor

    The command processor, or shell, is the user's interface to the operating
    system. It is responsible for parsing and carrying out user commands,
    including the loading and execution of other programs from a disk or other
    mass-storage device.

    The default shell that is provided with MS-DOS is found in a file called
    COMMAND.COM. Although COMMAND.COM prompts and responses constitute the
    ordinary user's complete perception of MS-DOS, it is important to realize
    that COMMAND.COM is not the operating system, but simply a special class
    of program running under the control of MS-DOS.

    COMMAND.COM can be replaced with a shell of the programmer's own design by
    simply adding a SHELL directive to the system-configuration file
    (CONFIG.SYS) on the system startup disk. The product COMMAND-PLUS from ESP
    Systems is an example of such an alternative shell.

    More about COMMAND.COM

    The default MS-DOS shell, COMMAND.COM, is divided into three parts:

    ■  A resident portion

    ■  An initialization section

    ■  A transient module

    The resident portion is loaded in lower memory, above the DOS kernel and
    its buffers and tables. It contains the routines to process Ctrl-C and
    Ctrl-Break, critical errors, and the termination (final exit) of other
    transient programs. This part of COMMAND.COM issues error messages and is
    responsible for the familiar prompt

    Abort, Retry, Ignore?

    The resident portion also contains the code required to reload the
    transient portion of COMMAND.COM when necessary.

    The initialization section of COMMAND.COM is loaded above the resident
    portion when the system is started. It processes the AUTOEXEC.BAT batch
    file (the user's list of commands to execute at system startup), if one is
    present, and is then discarded.

    The transient portion of COMMAND.COM is loaded at the high end of memory,
    and its memory can also be used for other purposes by application
    programs. The transient module issues the user prompt, reads the commands
    from the keyboard or batch file, and causes them to be executed. When an
    application program terminates, the resident portion of COMMAND.COM does a
    checksum of the transient module to determine whether it has been
    destroyed and fetches a fresh copy from the disk if necessary.

    The user commands that are accepted by COMMAND.COM fall into three
    categories:

    ■  Internal commands

    ■  External commands

    ■  Batch files

    Internal commands, sometimes called intrinsic commands, are those carried
    out by code embedded in COMMAND.COM itself. Commands in this category
    include COPY, REN(AME), DIR(ECTORY), and DEL(ETE). The routines for the
    internal commands are included in the transient part of COMMAND.COM.

    External commands, sometimes called extrinsic commands or transient
    programs, are the names of programs stored in disk files. Before these
    programs can be executed, they must be loaded from the disk into the
    transient program area (TPA) of memory. (See "How MS-DOS Is Loaded" in
    this chapter.) Familiar examples of external commands are CHKDSK, BACKUP,
    and RESTORE. As soon as an external command has completed its work, it is
    discarded from memory; hence, it must be reloaded from disk each time it
    is invoked.

    Batch files are text files that contain lists of other intrinsic,
    extrinsic, or batch commands. These files are processed by a special
    interpreter that is built into the transient portion of COMMAND.COM. The
    interpreter reads the batch file one line at a time and carries out each
    of the specified operations in order.

    In order to interpret a user's command, COMMAND.COM first looks to see if
    the user typed the name of a built-in (intrinsic) command that it can
    carry out directly. If not, it searches for an external command
    (executable program file) or batch file by the same name. The search is
    carried out first in the current directory of the current disk drive and
    then in each of the directories specified in the most recent PATH command.
    In each directory inspected, COMMAND.COM first tries to find a file with
    the extension .COM, then .EXE, and finally .BAT. If the search fails for
    all three file types in all of the possible locations, COMMAND.COM
    displays the familiar message

    Bad command or file name

    If a .COM file or a .EXE file is found, COMMAND.COM uses the MS-DOS EXEC
    function to load and execute it. The EXEC function builds a special data
    structure called a program segment prefix (PSP) above the resident portion
    of COMMAND.COM in the transient program area. The PSP contains various
    linkages and pointers needed by the application program. Next, the EXEC
    function loads the program itself, just above the PSP, and performs any
    relocation that may be necessary. Finally, it sets up the registers
    appropriately and transfers control to the entry point for the program.
    (Both the PSP and the EXEC function will be discussed in more detail in
    Chapters 3 and 12.) When the transient program has finished its job, it
    calls a special MS-DOS termination function that releases the transient
    program's memory and returns control to the program that caused the
    transient program to be loaded (COMMAND.COM, in this case).

    A transient program has nearly complete control of the system's resources
    while it is executing. The only other tasks that are accomplished are
    those performed by interrupt handlers (such as the keyboard input driver
    and the real-time clock) and operations that the transient program
    requests from the operating system. MS-DOS does not support sharing of the
    central processor among several tasks executing concurrently, nor can it
    wrest control away from a program when it crashes or executes for too
    long. Such capabilities are the province of MS OS/2, which is a
    protected-mode system with preemptive multitasking (time-slicing).


How MS-DOS Is Loaded

    When the system is started or reset, program execution begins at address
    0FFFF0H. This is a feature of the 8086/8088 family of microprocessors and
    has nothing to do with MS-DOS. Systems based on these processors are
    designed so that address 0FFFF0H lies within an area of ROM and contains a
    jump machine instruction to transfer control to system test code and the
    ROM bootstrap routine (Figure 2-1).

    The ROM bootstrap routine reads the disk bootstrap routine from the first
    sector of the system startup disk (the boot sector) into memory at some
    arbitrary address and then transfers control to it (Figure 2-2). (The
    boot sector also contains a table of information about the disk format.)

    The disk bootstrap routine checks to see if the disk contains a copy of
    MS-DOS. It does this by reading the first sector of the root directory and
    determining whether the first two files are IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS (or
    IBMBIO.COM and IBMDOS.COM), in that order. If these files are not present,
    the user is prompted to change disks and strike any key to try again.

    Figure 2-2.  The ROM bootstrap routine loads the disk bootstrap routine
    into memory from the first sector of the system startup disk and then
    transfers control to it.

    If the two system files are found, the disk bootstrap reads them into
    memory and transfers control to the initial entry point of IO.SYS (Figure
    2-3). (In some implementations, the disk bootstrap reads only IO.SYS into
    memory, and IO.SYS in turn loads the MSDOS.SYS file.)

    The IO.SYS file that is loaded from the disk actually consists of two
    separate modules. The first is the BIOS, which contains the linked set of
    resident device drivers for the console, auxiliary port, printer, block,
    and clock devices, plus some hardware-specific initialization code that is
    run only at system startup. The second module, SYSINIT, is supplied by
    Microsoft and linked into the IO.SYS file, along with the BIOS, by the
    computer manufacturer.

    SYSINIT is called by the manufacturer's BIOS initialization code. It
    determines the amount of contiguous memory present in the system and then
    relocates itself to high memory. Then it moves the DOS kernel, MSDOS.SYS,
    from its original load location to its final memory location, overlaying
    the original SYSINIT code and any other expendable initialization code
    that was contained in the IO.SYS file (Figure 2-4).

    Next, SYSINIT calls the initialization code in MSDOS.SYS. The DOS kernel
    initializes its internal tables and work areas, sets up the interrupt
    vectors 20H through 2FH, and traces through the linked list of resident
    device drivers, calling the initialization function for each. (See Chapter
    14.)

    Figure 2-3.  The disk bootstrap reads the file IO.SYS into memory. This
    file contains the MS-DOS BIOS (resident device drivers) and the SYSINIT
    module. Either the disk bootstrap or the BIOS (depending upon the
    manufacturer's implementation) then reads the DOS kernel into memory from
    the MSDOS.SYS file.

    These driver functions determine the equipment status, perform any
    necessary hardware initialization, and set up the vectors for any external
    hardware interrupts the drivers will service.

    As part of the initialization sequence, the DOS kernel examines the
    disk-parameter blocks returned by the resident block-device drivers,
    determines the largest sector size that will be used in the system, builds
    some drive-parameter blocks, and allocates a disk sector buffer. Control
    then returns to SYSINIT.

    When the DOS kernel has been initialized and all resident device drivers
    are available, SYSINIT can call on the normal MS-DOS file services to open
    the CONFIG.SYS file. This optional file can contain a variety of commands
    that enable the user to customize the MS-DOS environment. For instance,
    the user can specify additional hardware device drivers, the number of
    disk buffers, the maximum number of files that can be open at one time,
    and the filename of the command processor (shell).

    If it is found, the entire CONFIG.SYS file is loaded into memory for
    processing. All lowercase characters are converted to uppercase, and the
    file is interpreted one line at a time to process the commands. Memory is
    allocated for the disk buffer cache and the internal file control blocks
    used by the handle file and record system functions. (See Chapter 8.) Any
    device drivers indicated in the CONFIG.SYS file are sequentially loaded
    into memory, initialized by calls to their init modules, and linked into
    the device-driver list. The init function of each driver tells SYSINIT how
    much memory to reserve for that driver.

    Figure 2-4.  SYSINIT moves itself to high memory and relocates the DOS
    kernel, MSDOS.SYS, downward to its final address. The MS-DOS disk buffer
    cache and file control block areas are allocated, and then the installable
    device drivers specified in the CONFIG.SYS file are loaded and linked into
    the system.

    After all installable device drivers have been loaded, SYSINIT closes all
    file handles and reopens the console (CON), printer (PRN), and auxiliary
    (AUX) devices as the standard input, standard output, standard error,
    standard list, and standard auxiliary devices. This allows a
    user-installed character-device driver to override the BIOS's resident
    drivers for the standard devices.

    Finally, SYSINIT calls the MS-DOS EXEC function to load the command
    interpreter, or shell. (The default shell is COMMAND.COM, but another
    shell can be substituted by means of the CONFIG.SYS file.) Once the shell
    is loaded, it displays a prompt and waits for the user to enter a command.
    MS-DOS is now ready for business, and the SYSINIT module is discarded
    (Figure 2-5).

    Figure 2-5.  The final result of the MS-DOS startup process for a typical
    system. The resident portion of COMMAND.COM lies in low memory, above the
    DOS kernel. The transient portion containing the batch-file interpreter
    and intrinsic commands is placed in high memory, where it can be overlaid
    by extrinsic commands and application programs running in the transient
    program area.

Chapter 3  Structure of MS-DOS Application Programs

    Programs that run under MS-DOS come in two basic flavors: .COM programs,
    which have a maximum size of approximately 64 KB, and .EXE programs, which
    can be as large as available memory. In Intel 8086 parlance, .COM programs
    fit the tiny model, in which all segment registers contain the same value;
    that is, the code and data are mixed together. In contrast, .EXE programs
    fit the small, medium, or large model, in which the segment registers
    contain different values; that is, the code, data, and stack reside in
    separate segments. .EXE programs can have multiple code and data segments,
    which are respectively addressed by long calls and by manipulation of the
    data segment (DS) register.

    A .COM-type program resides on the disk as an absolute memory image, in a
    file with the extension .COM. The file does not have a header or any other
    internal identifying information. A .EXE program, on the other hand,
    resides on the disk in a special type of file with a unique header, a
    relocation map, a checksum, and other information that is (or can be) used
    by MS-DOS.

    Both .COM and .EXE programs are brought into memory for execution by the
    same mechanism: the EXEC function, which constitutes the MS-DOS loader.
    EXEC can be called with the filename of a program to be loaded by
    COMMAND.COM (the normal MS-DOS command interpreter), by other shells or
    user interfaces, or by another program that was previously loaded by EXEC.
    If there is sufficient free memory in the transient program area, EXEC
    allocates a block of memory to hold the new program, builds the program
    segment prefix (PSP) at its base, and then reads the program into memory
    immediately above the PSP. Finally, EXEC sets up the segment registers and
    the stack and transfers control to the program.

    When it is invoked, EXEC can be given the addresses of additional
    information, such as a command tail, file control blocks, and an
    environment block; if supplied, this information will be passed on to the
    new program. (The exact procedure for using the EXEC function in your own
    programs is discussed, with examples, in Chapter 12.)

    .COM and .EXE programs are often referred to as transient programs. A
    transient program "owns" the memory block it has been allocated and has
    nearly total control of the system's resources while it is executing. When
    the program terminates, either because it is aborted by the operating
    system or because it has completed its work and systematically performed a
    final exit back to MS-DOS, the memory block is then freed (hence the term
    transient) and can be used by the next program in line to be loaded.


The Program Segment Prefix

    A thorough understanding of the program segment prefix is vital to
    successful programming under MS-DOS. It is a reserved area, 256 bytes
    long, that is set up by MS-DOS at the base of the memory block allocated
    to a transient program. The PSP contains some linkages to MS-DOS that can
    be used by the transient program, some information MS-DOS saves for its
    own purposes, and some information MS-DOS passes to the transient
    program──to be used or not, as the program requires (Figure 3-1).

    Figure 3-1.  The structure of the program segment prefix.

    In the first versions of MS-DOS, the PSP was designed to be compatible
    with a control area that was built beneath transient programs under
    Digital Research's venerable CP/M operating system, so that programs could
    be ported to MS-DOS without extensive logical changes. Although MS-DOS has
    evolved considerably since those early days, the structure of the PSP is
    still recognizably similar to its CP/M equivalent. For example, offset
    0000H in the PSP contains a linkage to the MS-DOS process-termination
    handler, which cleans up after the program has finished its job and
    performs a final exit. Similarly, offset 0005H in the PSP contains a
    linkage to the MS-DOS function dispatcher, which performs disk operations,
    console input/output, and other such services at the request of the
    transient program. Thus, calls to PSP:0000 and PSP:0005 have the same
    effect as CALL 0000 and CALL 0005 under CP/M. (These linkages are not the
    "approved" means of obtaining these services, however.)

    The word at offset 0002H in the PSP contains the segment address of the
    top of the transient program's allocated memory block. The program can use
    this value to determine whether it should request more memory to do its
    job or whether it has extra memory that it can release for use by other
    processes.

    Offsets 000AH through 0015H in the PSP contain the previous contents of
    the interrupt vectors for the termination, Ctrl-C, and critical-error
    handlers. If the transient program alters these vectors for its own
    purposes, MS-DOS restores the original values saved in the PSP when the
    program terminates.

    The word at PSP offset 002CH holds the segment address of the environment
    block, which contains a series of ASCIIZ strings (sequences of ASCII
    characters terminated by a null, or zero, byte). The environment block is
    inherited from the program that called the EXEC function to load the
    currently executing program. It contains such information as the current
    search path used by COMMAND.COM to find executable programs, the location
    on the disk of COMMAND.COM itself, and the format of the user prompt used
    by COMMAND.COM.

    The command tail──the remainder of the command line that invoked the
    transient program, after the program's name──is copied into the PSP
    starting at offset 0081H. The length of the command tail, not including
    the return character at its end, is placed in the byte at offset 0080H.
    Redirection or piping parameters and their associated filenames do not
    appear in the portion of the command line (the command tail) that is
    passed to the transient program, because redirection is transparent to
    applications.

    To provide compatibility with CP/M, MS-DOS parses the first two parameters
    in the command tail into two default file control blocks (FCBs) at
    PSP:005CH and PSP:006CH, under the assumption that they may be filenames.
    However, if the parameters are filenames that include a path
    specification, only the drive code will be valid in these default FCBs,
    because FCB-type file- and record-access functions do not support
    hierarchical file structures. Although the default FCBs were an aid in
    earlier years, when compatibility with CP/M was more of a concern, they
    are essentially useless in modern MS-DOS application programs that must
    provide full path support. (File control blocks are discussed in detail in
    Chapter 8 and hierarchical file structures are discussed in Chapter 9.)

    The 128-byte area from 0080H through 00FFH in the PSP also serves as the
    default disk transfer area (DTA), which is set by MS-DOS before passing
    control to the transient program. If the program does not explicitly
    change the DTA, any file read or write operations requested with the FCB
    group of function calls automatically use this area as a data buffer. This
    is rarely useful and is another facet of MS-DOS's handling of the PSP that
    is present only for compatibility with CP/M.

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    WARNING
    Programs must not alter any part of the PSP below offset 005CH.

Introduction to .COM Programs

    Programs of the .COM persuasion are stored in disk files that hold an
    absolute image of the machine instructions to be executed. Because the
    files contain no relocation information, they are more compact, and are
    loaded for execution slightly faster, than equivalent .EXE files. Note
    that MS-DOS does not attempt to ascertain whether a .COM file actually
    contains executable code (there is no signature or checksum, as in the
    case of a .EXE file); it simply brings any file with the .COM extension
    into memory and jumps to it.

    Because .COM programs are loaded immediately above the program segment
    prefix and do not have a header that can specify another entry point, they
    must always have an origin of 0100H, which is the length of the PSP.
    Location 0100H must contain an executable instruction. The maximum length
    of a .COM program is 65,536 bytes, minus the length of the PSP (256 bytes)
    and a mandatory word of stack (2 bytes).

    When control is transferred to the .COM program from MS-DOS, all of the
    segment registers point to the PSP (Figure 3-2). The stack pointer
    register contains 0FFFEH if memory allows; otherwise, it is set as high as
    possible in memory minus 2 bytes. (MS-DOS pushes a zero word on the stack
    before entry.)

    Figure 3-2.  A memory image of a typical .COM-type program after loading.
    The contents of the .COM file are brought into memory just above the
    program segment prefix. Program, code, and data are mixed together in the
    same segment, and all segment registers contain the same value.

    Although the size of an executable .COM file can't exceed 64 KB, the
    current versions of MS-DOS allocate all of the transient program area to
    .COM programs when they are loaded. Because many such programs date from
    the early days of MS-DOS and are not necessarily "well-behaved" in their
    approach to memory management, the operating system simply makes the
    worst-case assumption and gives .COM programs everything that is
    available. If a .COM program wants to use the EXEC function to invoke
    another process, it must first shrink down its memory allocation to the
    minimum memory it needs in order to continue, taking care to protect its
    stack. (This is discussed in more detail in Chapter 12.)

    When a .COM program finishes executing, it can return control to MS-DOS by
    several means. The preferred method is Int 21H Function 4CH, which allows
    the program to pass a return code back to the program, shell, or batch
    file that invoked it. However, if the program is running under MS-DOS
    version 1, it must exit by means of Int 20H, Int 21H Function 0, or a
    NEAR RETURN. (Because a word of zero was pushed onto the stack at entry, a
    NEAR RETURN causes a transfer to PSP:0000, which contains an Int 20H
    instruction.)

    A .COM-type application can be linked together from many separate object
    modules. All of the modules must use the same code-segment name and class
    name, and the module with the entry point at offset 0100H within the
    segment must be linked first. In addition, all of the procedures within a
    .COM program should have the NEAR attribute, because all executable code
    resides in one segment.

    When linking a .COM program, the linker will display the message

    Warning: no stack segment

    This message can be ignored. The linker output is a .EXE file, which must
    be converted into a .COM file with the MS-DOS EXE2BIN utility before
    execution. You can then delete the .EXE file. (An example of this process
    is provided in Chapter 4.)

An Example .COM Program

    The HELLO.COM program listed in Figure 3-3 demonstrates the structure of
    a simple assembly-language program that is destined to become a .COM file.
    (You may find it helpful to compare this listing with the HELLO.EXE
    program later in this chapter.) Because this program is so short and
    simple, a relatively high proportion of the source code is actually
    assembler directives that do not result in any executable code.

    The NAME statement simply provides a module name for use during the
    linkage process. This aids understanding of the map that the linker
    produces. In MASM versions 5.0 and later, the module name is always the
    same as the filename, and the NAME statement is ignored.

    The PAGE command, when used with two operands, as in line 2, defines the
    length and width of the page. These default respectively to 66 lines and
    80 characters. If you use the PAGE command without any operands, a
    formfeed is sent to the printer and a heading is printed. In larger
    programs, use the PAGE command liberally to place each of your subroutines
    on separate pages for easy reading.

    The TITLE command, in line 3, specifies the text string (limited to 60
    characters) that is to be printed at the upper left corner of each page.
    The TITLE command is optional and cannot be used more than once in each
    assembly-language source file.

    Figure 3-3.  The HELLO.COM program listing.

    Dropping down past a few comments and EQU statements, we come to a
    declaration of a code segment that begins in line 22 with a SEGMENT
    command and ends in line 49 with an ENDS command. The label in the
    leftmost field of line 22 gives the code segment the name _TEXT. The
    operand fields at the right end of the line give the segment the
    attributes WORD, PUBLIC, and `CODE'. (You might find it helpful to read
    the Microsoft Macro Assembler manual for detailed explanations of each
    possible segment attribute.)

    Because this program is going to be converted into a .COM file, all of its
    executable code and data areas must lie within one code segment. The
    program must also have its origin at offset 0100H (immediately above the
    program segment prefix), which is taken care of by the ORG statement
    in line 24.

    Following the ORG instruction, we encounter an ASSUME statement on line
    27. The concept of ASSUME often baffles new assembly-language programmers.
    In a way, ASSUME doesn't "do" anything; it simply tells the assembler
    which segment registers you are going to use to point to the various
    segments of your program, so that the assembler can provide segment
    overrides when they are necessary. It's important to notice that the
    ASSUME statement doesn't take care of loading the segment registers with
    the proper values; it merely notifies the assembler of your intent to do
    that within the program. (Remember that, in the case of a .COM program,
    MS-DOS initializes all the segment registers before entry to point to the
    PSP.)

    Within the code segment, we come to another type of block declaration that
    begins with the PROC command on line 29 and closes with ENDP on line 40.
    These two instructions declare the beginning and end of a procedure, a
    block of executable code that performs a single distinct function. The
    label in the leftmost field of the PROC statement (in this case, print)
    gives the procedure a name. The operand field gives it an attribute. If
    the procedure carries the NEAR attribute, only other code in the same
    segment can call it, whereas if it carries the FAR attribute, code located
    anywhere in the CPU's memory-addressing space can call it. In .COM
    programs, all procedures carry the NEAR attribute.

    For the purposes of this example program, I have kept the print procedure
    ridiculously simple. It calls MS-DOS Int 21H Function 40H to send the
    message Hello World! to the video screen, and calls Int 21H Function 4CH
    to terminate the program.

    The END statement in line 51 tells the assembler that it has reached the
    end of the source file and also specifies the entry point for the program.
    If the entry point is not a label located at offset 0100H, the .EXE file
    resulting from the assembly and linkage of this source program cannot be
    converted into a .COM file.


Introduction to .EXE Programs

    We have just discussed a program that was written in such a way that it
    could be assembled into a .COM file. Such a program is simple in
    structure, so a programmer who needs to put together this kind of quick
    utility can concentrate on the program logic and do a minimum amount of
    worrying about control of the assembler. However, .COM-type programs have
    some definite disadvantages, and so most serious assembly-language efforts
    for MS-DOS are written to be converted into .EXE files.

    Although .COM programs are effectively restricted to a total size of 64 KB
    for machine code, data, and stack combined, .EXE programs can be
    practically unlimited in size (up to the limit of the computer's available
    memory). .EXE programs also place the code, data, and stack in separate
    parts of the file. Although the normal MS-DOS program loader does not take
    advantage of this feature of .EXE files, the ability to load different
    parts of large programs into several separate memory fragments, as well as
    the opportunity to designate a "pure" code portion of your program that
    can be shared by several tasks, is very significant in multitasking
    environments such as Microsoft Windows.

    The MS-DOS loader always brings a .EXE program into memory immediately
    above the program segment prefix, although the order of the code, data,
    and stack segments may vary (Figure 3-4). The .EXE file has a header, or
    block of control information, with a characteristic format (Figures 3-5
    and 3-6). The size of this header varies according to the number of
    program instructions that need to be relocated at load time, but it is
    always a multiple of 512 bytes.

    Before MS-DOS transfers control to the program, the initial values of the
    code segment (CS) register and instruction pointer (IP) register are
    calculated from the entry-point information in the .EXE file header and
    the program's load address. This information derives from an END statement
    in the source code for one of the program's modules. The data segment (DS)
    and extra segment (ES) registers are made to point to the PSP so that the
    program can access the environment-block pointer, command tail, and other
    useful information contained there.

    Figure 3-4.  A memory image of a typical .EXE-type program immediately
    after loading. The contents of the .EXE file are relocated and brought
    into memory above the program segment prefix. Code, data, and stack reside
    in separate segments and need not be in the order shown here. The entry
    point can be anywhere in the code segment and is specified by the END
    statement in the main module of the program. When the program receives
    control, the DS (data segment) and ES (extra segment) registers point to
    the program segment prefix; the program usually saves this value and then
    resets the DS and ES registers to point to its data area.

    The initial contents of the stack segment (SS) and stack pointer (SP)
    registers come from the header. This information derives from the
    declaration of a segment with the attribute STACK somewhere in the
    program's source code. The memory space allocated for the stack may be
    initialized or uninitialized, depending on the stack-segment definition;
    many programmers like to initialize the stack memory with a recognizable
    data pattern so that they can inspect memory dumps and determine how much
    stack space is actually used by the program.

    When a .EXE program finishes processing, it should return control to
    MS-DOS through Int 21H Function 4CH. Other methods are available, but
    they offer no advantages and are considerably less convenient (because
    they usually require the CS register to point to the PSP).

    Figure 3-5.  The format of a .EXE load module.

    The input to the linker for a .EXE-type program can be many separate
    object modules. Each module can use a unique code-segment name, and the
    procedures can carry either the NEAR or the FAR attribute, depending on
    naming conventions and the size of the executable code. The programmer
    must take care that the modules linked together contain only one segment
    with the STACK attribute and only one entry point defined with an END
    assembler directive. The output from the linker is a file with a .EXE
    extension. This file can be executed immediately.

    allocation (MAX_ALLOC) in bytes 000CH and 000DH, and the initial IP
    (instruction pointer) register value in bytes 0014H and 0015H. See also
    Figure 3-5.

An Example .EXE Program

    The HELLO.EXE program in Figure 3-7 demonstrates the fundamental
    structure of an assembly-language program that is destined to become a
    .EXE file. At minimum, it should have a module name, a code segment, a
    stack segment, and a primary procedure that receives control of the
    computer from MS-DOS after the program is loaded. The HELLO.EXE program
    also contains a data segment to provide a more complete example.

    The NAME, TITLE, and PAGE directives were covered in the HELLO.COM example
    program and are used in the same manner here, so we'll move to the first
    new item of interest. After a few comments and EQU statements, we come to
    a declaration of a code segment that begins on line 21 with a SEGMENT
    command and ends on line 41 with an ENDS command. As in the HELLO.COM
    example program, the label in the leftmost field of the line gives the
    code segment the name _TEXT. The operand fields at the right end of the
    line give the attributes WORD, PUBLIC, and `CODE'.

    Following the code-segment instruction, we find an ASSUME statement on
    line 23. Notice that, unlike the equivalent statement in the HELLO.COM
    program, the ASSUME statement in this program specifies several different
    segment names. Again, remember that this statement has no direct effect on
    the contents of the segment registers but affects only the operation of
    the assembler itself.

    Figure 3-7.  The HELLO.EXE program listing.

    Within the code segment, the main print procedure is declared by the PROC
    command on line 25 and closed with ENDP on line 39. Because the procedure
    resides in a .EXE file, we have given it the FAR attribute as an example,
    but the attribute is really irrelevant because the program is so small and
    the procedure is not called by anything else in the same program.

    The print procedure first initializes the DS register, as indicated in the
    earlier ASSUME statement, loading it with a value that causes it to point
    to the base of the data area. (MS-DOS automatically sets up the CS and SS
    registers.) Next, the procedure uses MS-DOS Int 21H Function 40H to
    display the message Hello World! on the screen, just as in the HELLO.COM
    program. Finally, the procedure exits back to MS-DOS with an Int 21H
    Function 4CH on lines 36 and 37, passing a return code of zero (which by
    convention means a success).

    Lines 44 through 51 declare a data segment named _DATA, which contains the
    variables and constants the program will use. If the various modules of a
    program contain multiple data segments with the same name, the linker will
    collect them and place them in the same physical memory segment.

    Lines 54 through 58 establish a stack segment; PUSH and POP instructions
    will access this area of scratch memory. Before MS-DOS transfers control
    to a .EXE program, it sets up the SS and SP registers according to the
    declared size and location of the stack segment. Be sure to allow enough
    room for the maximum stack depth that can occur at runtime, plus a safe
    number of extra words for registers pushed onto the stack during an MS-DOS
    service call. If the stack overflows, it may damage your other code and
    data segments and cause your program to behave strangely or even to crash
    altogether!

    The END statement on line 60 winds up our brief HELLO.EXE program, telling
    the assembler that it has reached the end of the source file and providing
    the label of the program's point of entry from MS-DOS.

    The differences between .COM and .EXE programs are summarized in Figure
    3-8.

More About Assembly-Language Programs

    Now that we've looked at working examples of .COM and .EXE
    assembly-language programs, let's backtrack and discuss their elements a
    little more formally. The following discussion is based on the Microsoft
    Macro Assembler, hereafter referred to as MASM. If you are familiar with
    MASM and are an experienced assembly-language programmer, you may want to
    skip this section.

    MASM programs can be thought of as having three structural levels:

    ■  The module level

    ■  The segment level

    ■  The procedure level

    Modules are simply chunks of source code that can be independently
    maintained and assembled. Segments are physical groupings of like items
    (machine code or data) within a program and a corresponding segregation of
    dissimilar items. Procedures are functional subdivisions of an executable
    program──routines that carry out a particular task.

Program Modules

    Under MS-DOS, the module-level structure consists of files containing the
    source code for individual routines. Each source file is translated by the
    assembler into a relocatable object module. An object module can reside
    alone in an individual file or with many other object modules in an
    object-module library of frequently used or related routines. The
    Microsoft Object Linker (LINK) combines object-module files, often with
    additional object modules extracted from libraries, into an executable
    program file.

    Using modules and object-module libraries reduces the size of your
    application source files (and vastly increases your productivity), because
    these files need not contain the source code for routines they have in
    common with other programs. This technique also allows you to maintain the
    routines more easily, because you need to alter only one copy of their
    source code stored in one place, instead of many copies stored in
    different applications. When you improve (or fix) one of these routines,
    you can simply reassemble it, put its object module back into the library,
    relink all of the programs that use the routine, and voilga: instant
    upgrade.

Program Segments

    The term segments refers to two discrete programming concepts: physical
    segments and logical segments.

    Physical segments are 64 KB blocks of memory. The Intel 8086/8088 and
    80286 microprocessors have four segment registers, which are essentially
    used as pointers to these blocks. (The 80386 has six segment registers,
    which are a superset of those found on the 8086/8088 and 80286.) Each
    segment register can point to the bottom of a different 64 KB area of
    memory. Thus, a program can address any location in memory by appropriate
    manipulation of the segment registers, but the maximum amount of memory
    that it can address simultaneously is 256 KB.

    As we discussed earlier in the chapter, .COM programs assume that all four
    segment registers always point to the same place──the bottom of the
    program. Thus, they are limited to a maximum size of 64 KB. .EXE programs,
    on the other hand, can address many different physical segments and can
    reset the segment registers to point to each segment as it is needed.
    Consequently, the only practical limit on the size of a .EXE program is
    the amount of available memory. The example programs throughout the
    remainder of this book focus on .EXE programs.

    Logical segments are the program components. A minimum of three logical
    segments must be declared in any .EXE program: a code segment, a data
    segment, and a stack segment. Programs with more than 64 KB of code or
    data have more than one code or data segment. The routines or data that
    are used most frequently are put into the primary code and data segments
    for speed, and routines or data that are used less frequently are put into
    secondary code and data segments.

    Segments are declared with the SEGMENT and ENDS directives in the
    following form:

    name   SEGMENT attributes
    .
    .
    .
    name   ENDS

    The attributes of a segment include its align type (BYTE, WORD, or PARA),
    combine type (PUBLIC, PRIVATE, COMMON, or STACK), and class type. The
    segment attributes are used by the linker when it is combining logical
    segments to create the physical segments of an executable program. Most of
    the time, you can get by just fine using a small selection of attributes
    in a rather stereotypical way. However, if you want to use the full range
    of attributes, you might want to read the detailed explanation in the MASM
    manual.

    Programs are classified into one memory model or another based on the
    number of their code and data segments. The most commonly used memory
    model for assembly-language programs is the small model, which has one
    code and one data segment, but you can also use the medium, compact, and
    large models (Figure 3-9). (Two additional models exist with which we
    will not be concerning ourselves further: the tiny model, which consists
    of intermixed code and data in a single segment── for example, a .COM file
    under MS-DOS; and the huge model, which is supported by the Microsoft C
    Optimizing Compiler and which allows use of data structures larger than 64
    KB.)

    Model                    Code segments           Data segments
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Small                    One                     One
    Medium                   Multiple                One
    Compact                  One                     Multiple
    Large                    Multiple                Multiple
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Figure 3-9.  Memory models commonly used in assembly-language and C
    programs.

    For each memory model, Microsoft has established certain segment and class
    names that are used by all its high-level-language compilers (Figure
    3-10). Because segment names are arbitrary, you may as well adopt the
    Microsoft conventions. Their use will make it easier for you to integrate
    your assembly-language routines into programs written in languages such as
    C, or to use routines from high-level-language libraries in your
    assembly-language programs.

    Another important Microsoft high-level-language convention is to use the
    GROUP directive to name the near data segment (the segment the program
    expects to address with offsets from the DS register) and the stack
    segment as members of DGROUP (the automatic data group), a special name
    recognized by the linker and also by the program loaders in Microsoft
    Windows and Microsoft OS/2. The GROUP directive causes logical segments
    with different names to be combined into a single physical segment so that
    they can be addressed using the same segment base address. In C programs,
    DGROUP also contains the local heap, which is used by the C runtime
    library for dynamic allocation of small amounts of memory.

    Figure 3-10.  Segments, groups, and classes for the standard memory models
    as used with assembly-language programs. The Microsoft C Optimizing
    Compiler and other high-level-language compilers use a superset of these
    segments and classes.

    For pure assembly-language programs that will run under MS-DOS, you can
    ignore DGROUP. However, if you plan to integrate assembly-language
    routines and programs written in high-level languages, you'll want to
    follow the Microsoft DGROUP convention. For example, if you are planning
    to link routines from a C library into an assembly-language program, you
    should include the line

    DGROUP group _DATA,STACK

    near the beginning of the program.

    The final Microsoft convention of interest in creating .EXE programs is
    segment order. The high-level compilers assume that code segments always
    come first, followed by far data segments, followed by the near data
    segment, with the stack and heap last. This order won't concern you much
    until you begin integrating assembly-language code with routines from
    high-level-language libraries, but it is easiest to learn to use the
    convention right from the start.

Program Procedures

    The procedure level of program structure is partly real and partly
    conceptual. Procedures are basically just a fancy guise for subroutines.

    Procedures within a program are declared with the PROC and ENDP directives
    in the following form:

    name   PROC attribute
    .
    .
    .
            RET
    name   ENDP

    The attribute carried by a PROC declaration, which is either NEAR or FAR,
    tells the assembler what type of call you expect to use to enter the
    procedure──that is, whether the procedure will be called from other
    routines in the same segment or from routines in other segments. When the
    assembler encounters a RET instruction within the procedure, it uses the
    attribute information to generate the correct opcode for either a near
    (intra-segment) or far (inter-segment) return.

    Each program should have a main procedure that receives control from
    MS-DOS. You specify the entry point for the program by including the name
    of the main procedure in the END statement in one of the program's source
    files. The main procedure's attribute (NEAR or FAR) is really not too
    important, because the program returns control to MS-DOS with a function
    call rather than a RET instruction. However, by convention, most
    programmers assign the main procedure the FAR attribute anyway.

    You should break the remainder of the program into procedures in an
    orderly way, with each procedure performing a well-defined single
    function, returning its results to its caller, and avoiding actions that
    have global effects within the program. Ideally procedures invoke each
    other only by CALL instructions, have only one entry point and one exit
    point, and always exit by means of a RET instruction, never by jumping to
    some other location within the program.

    For ease of understanding and maintenance, a procedure should not exceed
    one page (about 60 lines); if it is longer than a page, it is probably too
    complex and you should delegate some of its function to one or more
    subsidiary procedures. You should preface the source code for each
    procedure with a detailed comment that states the procedure's calling
    sequence, results returned, registers affected, and any data items
    accessed or modified. The effort invested in making your procedures
    compact, clean, flexible, and well-documented will be repaid many times
    over when you reuse the procedures in other programs.

Chapter 4  MS-DOS Programming Tools

    Preparing a new program to run under MS-DOS is an iterative process with
    four basic steps:

    ■  Use of a text editor to create or modify an ASCII source-code file

    ■  Use of an assembler or high-level-language compiler (such as the
        Microsoft Macro Assembler or the Microsoft C Optimizing Compiler) to
        translate the source file into relocatable object code

    ■  Use of a linker to transform the relocatable object code into an
        executable MS-DOS load module

    ■  Use of a debugger to methodically test and debug the program

    Additional utilities the MS-DOS software developer may find necessary or
    helpful include the following:

    ■  LIB, which creates and maintains object-module libraries

    ■  CREF, which generates a cross-reference listing

    ■  EXE2BIN, which converts .EXE files to .COM files

    ■  MAKE, which compares dates of files and carries out operations based on
        the result of the comparison

    This chapter gives an operational overview of the Microsoft programming
    tools for MS-DOS, including the assembler, the C compiler, the linker, and
    the librarian. In general, the information provided here also applies to
    the IBM programming tools for MS-DOS, which are really the Microsoft
    products with minor variations and different version numbers. Even if your
    preferred programming language is not C or assembly language, you will
    need at least a passing familiarity with these tools because all of the
    examples in the IBM and Microsoft DOS reference manuals are written in one
    of these languages.

    The survey in this chapter, together with the example programs and
    reference section elsewhere in the book, should provide the experienced
    programmer with sufficient information to immediately begin writing useful
    programs. Readers who do not have a background in C, assembly language, or
    the Intel 80x86 microprocessor architecture should refer to the tutorial
    and reference works listed at the end of this chapter.


File Types

    The MS-DOS programming tools can create and process many different file
    types. The following extensions are used by convention for these files:

╓┌─┌──────────┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╖
    Extension  File type
    Extension  File type
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    .ASM       Assembly-language source file

    .C         C source file

    .COM       MS-DOS executable load module that does not require relocation
                at runtime

    .CRF       Cross-reference information file produced by the assembler for
                processing by CREF.EXE

    .DEF       Module-definition file describing a program's segment behavior
                (MS OS/2 and Microsoft Windows programs only; not relevant to
                normal MS-DOS applications)

    .EXE       MS-DOS executable load module that requires relocation at
                runtime

    .H         C header file containing C source code for constants, macros,
                and functions; merged into another C program with the #include
    Extension  File type
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                and functions; merged into another C program with the #include
                directive

    .INC       Include file for assembly-language programs, typically
                containing macros and/or equates for systemwide values such as
                error codes

    .LIB       Object-module library file made up of one or more .OBJ files;
                indexed and manipulated by LIB.EXE

    .LST       Program listing, produced by the assembler, that includes
                memory locations, machine code, the original program text, and
                error messages

    .MAP       Listing of symbols and their locations within a load module;
                produced by the linker

    .OBJ       Relocatable-object-code file produced by an assembler or
                compiler
    Extension  File type
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                compiler

    .REF       Cross-reference listing produced by CREF.EXE from the
                information in a .CRF file
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────



The Microsoft Macro Assembler

    The Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) is distributed as the file MASM.EXE.
    When beginning a program translation, MASM needs the following
    information:

    ■  The name of the file containing the source program

    ■  The filename for the object program to be created

    ■  The destination of the program listing

    ■  The filename for the information that is later processed by the
        cross-reference utility (CREF.EXE)

    You can invoke MASM in two ways. If you enter the name of the assembler
    alone, it prompts you for the names of each of the various input and
    output files. The assembler supplies reasonable defaults for all the
    responses except the source filename, as shown in the following example:

    C&gt;MASM  &lt;Enter&gt;

    Microsoft (R) Macro Assembler Version 5.10
    Copyright (C) Microsoft Corp 1981, 1988. All rights reserved.

    Source filename [.ASM]: HELLO  &lt;Enter&gt;
    Object filename [HELLO.OBJ]:  &lt;Enter&gt;
    Source listing  [NUL.LST]:  &lt;Enter&gt;
    Cross-reference [NUL.CRF]:  &lt;Enter&gt;

    49006 Bytes symbol space free

        0 Warning Errors
        0 Severe Errors

    C&gt;

    You can use a logical device name (such as PRN or COM1) at any of the MASM
    prompts to send that output of the assembler to a character device rather
    than a file. Note that the default for the listing and cross-reference
    files is the NUL device──that is, no file is created. If you end any
    response with a semicolon, MASM assumes that the remaining responses are
    all to be the default.

    A more efficient way to use MASM is to supply all parameters in the
    command line, as follows:

    MASM [options] source,[object],[listing],[crossref]

    For example, the following command lines are equivalent to the preceding
    interactive session:

    C&gt;MASM HELLO,,NUL,NUL  &lt;Enter&gt;

    or

    C&gt;MASM HELLO;  &lt;Enter&gt;

    These commands use the file HELLO.ASM as the source, generate the
    object-code file HELLO.OBJ, and send the listing and cross-reference files
    to the bit bucket.

    MASM accepts several optional switches in the command line, to control
    code generation and output files. Figure 4-1 lists the switches accepted
    by MASM version 5.1. As shown in the following example, you can put
    frequently used options in a MASM environment variable, where they will be
    found automatically by the assembler:

    C&gt;SET MASM=/T /Zi  &lt;Enter&gt;

    The switches in the environment variable will be overridden by any that
    you enter in the command line.

    In other versions of the Microsoft Macro Assembler, additional or fewer
    switches may be available. For exact instructions, see the manual for the
    version of MASM that you are using.

    Figure 4-1.  Microsoft Macro Assembler version 5.1 switches.

    MASM allows you to override the default extensions on any file──a feature
    that can be rather dangerous. For example, if in the preceding example you
    had responded to the Object filename prompt with HELLO.ASM, the assembler
    would have accepted the entry without comment and destroyed your source
    file. This is not too likely to happen in the interactive command mode,
    but you must be very careful with file extensions when MASM is used in a
    batch file.


The Microsoft C Optimizing Compiler

    The Microsoft C Optimizing Compiler consists of three executable files──
    C1.EXE, C2.EXE, and C3.EXE──that implement the C preprocessor, language
    translator, code generator, and code optimizer. An additional control
    program, CL.EXE, executes the three compiler files in order, passing each
    the necessary information about filenames and compilation options.

    Before using the C compiler and the linker, you need to set up four
    environment variables:

    Variable                 Action
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    PATH=path                Specifies the location of the three executable C
                            compiler files (C1, C2, and C3) if they are not
                            in the current directory; used by CL.EXE.

    INCLUDE=path             Specifies the location of #include files (default
                            extension .H) that are not found in the current
                            directory.

    LIB=path                 Specifies the location(s) for object-code
                            libraries that are not found in the current
                            directory.

    TMP=path                 Specifies the location for temporary working
                            files created by the C compiler and linker.
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    CL.EXE does not support an interactive mode or response files. You always
    invoke it with a command line of the following form:

    CL [options] file [file ...]

    You may list any number of files──if a file has a .C extension, it will be
    compiled into a relocatable-object-module (.OBJ) file. Ordinarily, if the
    compiler encounters no errors, it automatically passes all resulting .OBJ
    files and any additional .OBJ files specified in the command line to the
    linker, along with the names of the appropriate runtime libraries.

    The C compiler has many optional switches controlling its memory models,

    in Figure 4-2. The C compiler's arcane switch syntax is derived largely
    from UNIX/XENIX, so don't expect it to make any sense.

The Microsoft Object Linker

    The object module produced by MASM from a source file is in a form that
    contains relocation information and may also contain unresolved references
    to external locations or subroutines. It is written in a common format
    that is also produced by the various high-level compilers (such as FORTRAN
    and C) that run under MS-DOS. The computer cannot execute object modules
    without further processing.

    The Microsoft Object Linker (LINK), distributed as the file LINK.EXE,
    accepts one or more of these object modules, resolves external references,
    includes any necessary routines from designated libraries, performs any
    necessary offset relocations, and writes a file that can be loaded and
    executed by MS-DOS. The output of LINK is always in .EXE load-module
    format. (See Chapter 3.)

    As with MASM, you can give LINK its parameters interactively or by
    entering all the required information in a single command line. If you
    enter the name of the linker alone, the following type of dialog ensues:

    C&gt;LINK  &lt;Enter&gt;

    Microsoft (R) Overlay Linker  Version 3.61
    Copyright (C) Microsoft Corp 1983-1987. All rights reserved.

    Object Modules [.OBJ]: HELLO  &lt;Enter&gt;
    Run File [HELLO.EXE]:  &lt;Enter&gt;
    List File [NUL.MAP]: HELLO  &lt;Enter&gt;
    Libraries [.LIB]:  &lt;Enter&gt;

    C&gt;

    If you are using LINK version 4.0 or later, the linker also asks for the
    name of a module-definition (.DEF) file. Simply press the Enter key in
    response to such a prompt. Module-definition files are used when building
    Microsoft Windows or MS OS/2 "new .EXE" executable files but are not
    relevant in normal MS-DOS applications.

    The input file for this example was HELLO.OBJ; the output files were
    HELLO.EXE (the executable program) and HELLO.MAP (the load map produced by
    the linker after all references and addresses were resolved). Figure 4-3
    shows the load map.

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Figure 4-3.  Map produced by the Microsoft Object Linker (LINK) during the
    generation of the HELLO.EXE program from Chapter 3. The program contains
    one CODE, one DATA, and one STACK segment. The first instruction to be
    executed lies in the first byte of the CODE segment. The $$TYPES and
    $$SYMBOLS segments contain information for the CodeView debugger and are
    not part of the program; these segments are ignored by the normal MS-DOS
    loader.

    You can obtain the same result more quickly by entering all parameters in
    the command line, in the following form:

    LINK options objectfile, [exefile], [mapfile], [libraries]

    Thus, the command-line equivalent to the preceding interactive session is

    C&gt;LINK HELLO,HELLO,HELLO,,  &lt;Enter&gt;

    or

    C&gt;LINK HELLO,,HELLO;  &lt;Enter&gt;

    If you enter a semicolon as the last character in the command line, LINK
    assumes the default values for all further parameters.

    A third method of commanding LINK is with a response file. A response file
    contains lines of text that correspond to the responses you would give the
    linker interactively. You specify the name of the response file in the
    command line with a leading @ character, as follows:

    LINK @filename

    You can also enter the name of a response file at any prompt. If the
    response file is not complete, LINK will prompt you for the missing
    information.

    When entering linker commands, you can specify multiple object files with
    the + operator or with spaces, as in the following example:

    C&gt;LINK HELLO+VMODE+DOSINT,MYPROG,,GRAPHICS;  &lt;Enter&gt;

    This command would link the files HELLO.OBJ, VMODE.OBJ, and DOSINT.OBJ,
    searching the library file GRAPHICS.LIB to resolve any references to
    symbols not defined in the specified object files, and would produce a
    file named MYPROG.EXE. LINK uses the current drive and directory when they
    are not explicitly included in a filename; it will not automatically use
    the same drive and directory you specified for a previous file in the same
    command line.

    By using the + operator or space characters in the libraries field, you
    can specify up to 32 library files to be searched. Each high-level-
    language compiler provides default libraries that are searched
    automatically during the linkage process if the linker can find them
    (unless they are explicitly excluded with the /NOD switch). LINK looks for
    libraries first in the current directory of the default disk drive, then
    along any paths that were provided in the command line, and finally along
    the path(s) specified by the LIB variable if it is present in the
    environment.

    LINK accepts several optional switches as part of the command line or at
    the end of any interactive prompt. Figure 4-4 lists these switches. The
    number of switches available and their actions vary among different
    versions of LINK. See your Microsoft Object Linker instruction manual for
    detailed information about your particular version.

    Figure 4-4.  Switches accepted by the Microsoft Object Linker (LINK)
    version 5.0. Earlier versions use a subset of these switches. Note that
    any abbreviation for a switch is acceptable as long as it is sufficient to
    specify the switch uniquely.


The EXE2BIN Utility

    The EXE2BIN utility (EXE2BIN.EXE) transforms a .EXE file created by LINK
    into an executable .COM file, if the program meets the following
    prerequisites:

    ■  It cannot contain more than one declared segment and cannot
        define a stack.

    ■  It must be less than 64 KB in length.

    ■  It must have an origin at 0100H.

    ■  The first location in the file must be specified as the entry point
        in the source code's END directive.

    Although .COM files are somewhat more compact than .EXE files, you should
    avoid using them. Programs that use separate segments for code, data, and
    stack are much easier to port to protected-mode environments such as MS
    OS/2; in addition, .COM files do not support the symbolic debugging
    information used by CodeView.

    Another use for the EXE2BIN utility is to convert an installable device
    driver──after it is assembled and linked into a .EXE file──into a
    memory-image .BIN or .SYS file with an origin of zero. This conversion is
    required in MS-DOS version 2, which cannot load device drivers as .EXE
    files. The process of writing an installable device driver is discussed in
    more detail in Chapter 14.

    Unlike most of the other programming utilities, EXE2BIN does not have an
    interactive mode. It always takes its source and destination filenames,
    separated by spaces, from the MS-DOS command line, as follows:

    EXE2BIN sourcefile [destinationfile]

    If you do not supply the source-file extension, it defaults to .EXE; the
    destination-file extension defaults to .BIN. If you do not specify a name
    for the destination file, EXE2BIN gives it the same name as the source
    file, with a .BIN extension.

    For example, to convert the file HELLO.EXE into HELLO.COM, you would use
    the following command line:

    C&gt;EXE2BIN HELLO.EXE HELLO.COM  &lt;Enter&gt;

    The EXE2BIN program also has other capabilities, such as pure binary
    conversion with segment fixup for creating program images to be placed in
    ROM; but because these features are rarely used during MS-DOS application
    development, they will not be discussed here.


The CREF Utility

    The CREF cross-reference utility CREF.EXE processes a .CRF file produced
    by MASM, creating an ASCII text file with the default extension .REF. The
    file contains a cross-reference listing of all symbols declared in the
    program and the line numbers in which they are referenced. (See Figure
    4-5.) Such a listing is very useful when debugging large
    assembly-language programs with many interdependent procedures and
    variables.

    CREF may be supplied with its parameters interactively or in a single
    command line. If you enter the utility name alone, CREF prompts you for
    the input and output filenames, as shown in the following example:

    C&gt;CREF  &lt;Enter&gt;

    Figure 4-5.  Cross-reference listing HELLO.REF produced by the CREF
    utility from the file HELLO.CRF, for the HELLO.EXE program example from
    Chapter 3. The symbols declared in the program are listed on the left in
    alphabetic order. To the right of each symbol is a list of all the lines
    where that symbol is referenced. The number with a # sign after it denotes
    the line where the symbol is declared. Numbers followed by a + sign
    indicate that the symbol is modified at the specified line. The line
    numbers given in the cross-reference listing correspond to the line
    numbers generated by the assembler in the program-listing (.LST) file, not
    to any physical line count in the original source file.

    The parameters may also be entered in the command line in the following
    form:

    CREF CRF_file, listing_file

    For example, the command-line equivalent to the preceding interactive
    session is:

    C&gt;CREF HELLO,HELLO  &lt;Enter&gt;

    If CREF cannot find the specified .CRF file, it displays an error message.
    Otherwise, it leaves the cross-reference listing in the specified file on
    the disk. You can send the file to the printer with the COPY command, in
    the following form:

    COPY listing_file PRN:

    You can also send the cross-reference listing directly to a character
    device as it is generated by responding to the Listing prompt with the
    name of the device.


The Microsoft Library Manager

    Although the object modules that are produced by MASM or by high-level-
    language compilers can be linked directly into executable load modules,
    they can also be collected into special files called object-module
    libraries. The modules in a library are indexed by name and by the public
    symbols they contain, so that they can be extracted by the linker to
    satisfy external references in a program.

    The Microsoft Library Manager (LIB) is distributed as the file LIB.EXE.
    LIB creates and maintains program libraries, adding, updating, and
    deleting object files as necessary. LIB can also check a library file for
    internal consistency or print a table of its contents (Figure 4-6).

    LIB follows the command conventions of most other Microsoft programming
    tools. You must supply it with the name of a library file to work on, one
    or more operations to perform, the name of a listing file or device, and
    (optionally) the name of the output library. If you do not specify a name
    for the output library, LIB gives it the same name as the input library
    and changes the extension of the input library to .BAK.

    The LIB operations are simply the names of object files, with a prefix
    character that specifies the action to be taken:

    Prefix     Meaning
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    -          Delete an object module from the library.
    *          Extract a module and place it in a separate .OBJ file.
    +          Add an object module or the entire contents of another library
                to the library.
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    You can combine command prefixes. For example, -+ replaces a module, and
    *- extracts a module into a new file and then deletes it from the library.

    Figure 4-6.  Extract from the table-of-contents listing produced by the
    Microsoft Library Manager (LIB) for the Microsoft C library SLIBC.LIB. The
    first part of the listing is an alphabetic list of all public names
    declared in all of the modules in the library. Each name is associated
    with the object module to which it belongs. The second part of the listing
    is an alphabetic list of the object-module names in the library, each
    followed by its offset within the library file and the actual size of the
    module in bytes. The entry for each module is followed by a summary of the
    public names that are declared within it.

    When you invoke LIB with its name alone, it requests the other information
    it needs interactively, as shown in the following example:

    C&gt;LIB  &lt;Enter&gt;

    Microsoft (R) Library Manager  Version 3.08
    Copyright (C) Microsoft Corp 1983-1987. All rights reserved.

    Library name:  SLIBC  &lt;Enter&gt;
    Operations: +VIDEO  &lt;Enter&gt;
    List file:  SLIBC.LST  &lt;Enter&gt;
    Output library:  SLIBC2  &lt;Enter&gt;

    C&gt;

    In this example, LIB added the object module VIDEO.OBJ to the library
    SLIBC.LIB, wrote a library table of contents into the file SLIBC.LST, and
    named the resulting new library SLIBC2.LIB.

    The Library Manager can also be run with a command line of the following
    form:

    LIB library [commands],[list],[newlibrary]

    For example, the following command line is equivalent to the preceding
    interactive session:

    C&gt;LIB SLIBC +VIDEO,SLIBC.LST,SLIBC2;  &lt;Enter&gt;

    As with the other Microsoft utilities, a semicolon at the end of the
    command line causes LIB to use the default responses for any parameters
    that are omitted.

    Like LINK, LIB can also accept its commands from a response file. The
    contents of the file are lines of text that correspond exactly to the
    responses you would give LIB interactively. You specify the name of the
    response file in the command line with a leading @ character, as follows:

    LIB @filename

    LIB has only three switches: /I (/IGNORECASE), /N (/NOIGNORECASE), and
    /PAGESIZE:number. The /IGNORECASE switch is the default. The /NOIGNORECASE
    switch causes LIB to regard as distinct any symbols that differ only in
    the case of their component letters. You should place the /PAGESIZE
    switch, which defines the size of a unit of allocation space for a given
    library, immediately after the library filename. The library page size is
    in bytes and must be a power of 2 between 16 and 32,768 (16, 32, 64, and
    so forth); the default is 16 bytes. Because the index to a library is
    always a fixed number of pages, setting a larger page size allows you to
    store more object modules in that library; on the other hand, it will
    result in more wasted space within the file.


The MAKE Utility

    The MAKE utility (MAKE.EXE) compares dates of files and carries out
    commands based on the result of that comparison. Because of this single,
    rather basic capability, MAKE can be used to maintain complex programs
    built from many modules. The dates of source, object, and executable files
    are simply compared in a logical sequence; the assembler, compiler,
    linker, and other programming tools are invoked as appropriate.

    The MAKE utility processes a plain ASCII text file called, as you might
    expect, a make file. You start the utility with a command-line entry in
    the following form:

    MAKE makefile [options]

    By convention, a make file has the same name as the executable file that
    is being maintained, but without an extension. The available MAKE switches
    are listed in Figure 4-7.

    A simple make file contains one or more dependency statements separated by
    blank lines. Each dependency statement can be followed by a list of MS-DOS
    commands, in the following form:

    targetfile : sourcefile ...

        command

        command

        .

        .

        .

    If the date and time of any source file are later than those of the target
    file, the accompanying list of commands is carried out. You may use
    comment lines, which begin with a # character, freely in a make file. MAKE
    can also process inference rules and macro definitions. For further
    details on these advanced capabilities, see the Microsoft or IBM
    documentation.

    Switch     Meaning

    /D         Display last modification date of each file as it is processed.
    /I         Ignore exit (return) codes returned by commands and programs
                executed as a result of dependency statements.
    /N         Display commands that would be executed as a result of
                dependency statements but do not execute those commands.
    /S         Do not display commands as they are executed.
    /X         Direct error messages from MAKE, or any program that MAKE runs,
    &lt;filename&gt; to the specified file. If filename is a hyphen (-), direct
                error messages to the standard output.

A Complete Example

    Let's put together everything we've learned about using the MS-DOS
    programming tools so far. Figure 4-8 shows a sketch of the overall
    process of building an executable program.

    Assume that we have the source code for the HELLO.EXE program from Chapter
    3 in the file HELLO.ASM. To assemble the source program into the
    relocatable object module HELLO.OBJ with symbolic debugging information
    included, also producing a program listing in the file HELLO.LST and a
    cross-reference data file HELLO.CRF, we would enter

    C&gt;MASM /C /L /Zi /T HELLO;  &lt;Enter&gt;

    To convert the cross-reference raw-data file HELLO.CRF into a
    cross-reference listing in the file HELLO.REF, we would enter

    C&gt;CREF HELLO,HELLO  &lt;Enter&gt;

    Figure 4-8.  Creation of an MS-DOS application program, from source code
    to executable file.

    To convert the relocatable object file HELLO.OBJ into the executable file
    HELLO.EXE, creating a load map in the file HELLO.MAP and appending
    symbolic debugging information to the executable file, we would enter

    C&gt;LINK /MAP /CODEVIEW HELLO;  &lt;Enter&gt;

    We could also automate the entire process just described by creating a
    make file named HELLO (with no extension) and including the following
    instructions:

    hello.obj : hello.asm
    masm /C /L /Zi /T hello;
    cref hello,hello

    hello.exe : hello.obj
    link /MAP /CODEVIEW hello;

    Then, when we have made some change to HELLO.ASM and want to rebuild the
    executable HELLO.EXE file, we need only enter

    C&gt;MAKE HELLO  &lt;Enter&gt;

Chapter 5  Keyboard and Mouse Input

    The fundamental means of user input under MS-DOS is the keyboard. This
    follows naturally from the MS-DOS command-line interface, whose lineage
    can be traced directly to minicomputer operating systems with Teletype
    consoles. During the first few years of MS-DOS's existence, when
    8088/8086-based machines were the norm, nearly every popular application
    program used key-driven menus and text-mode displays.

    However, as high-resolution graphics adapters (and 80286/80386-based
    machines with enough power to drive them) have become less expensive,
    programs that support windows and a graphical user interface have steadily
    grown more popular. Such programs typically rely on a pointing device such
    as a mouse, stylus, joystick, or light pen to let the user navigate in a
    "point-and-shoot" manner, reducing keyboard entry to a minimum. As a
    result, support for pointing devices has become an important consideration
    for all software developers.


Keyboard Input Methods

    Applications running under MS-DOS on IBM PC─compatible machines can use
    several methods to obtain keyboard input:

    ■  MS-DOS handle-oriented functions

    ■  MS-DOS traditional character functions

    ■  IBM ROM BIOS keyboard-driver functions

    These methods offer different degrees of flexibility, portability, and
    hardware independence.

    The handle, or stream-oriented, functions are philosophically derived from
    UNIX/XENIX and were first introduced in MS-DOS version 2.0. A program uses
    these functions by supplying a handle, or token, for the desired device,
    plus the address and length of a buffer.

    When a program begins executing, MS-DOS supplies it with predefined
    handles for certain commonly used character devices, including the
    keyboard:

    Handle             Device name                          Opened to
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    0                  Standard input (stdin)               CON
    1                  Standard output (stdout)             CON
    2                  Standard error (stderr)              CON
    3                  Standard auxiliary (stdaux)          AUX
    4                  Standard printer (stdprn)            PRN
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    These handles can be used for read and write operations without further
    preliminaries. A program can also obtain a handle for a character device
    by explicitly opening the device for input or output using its logical
    name (as though it were a file). The handle functions support I/O
    redirection, allowing a program to take its input from another device or
    file instead of the keyboard, for example. Redirection is discussed in
    detail in Chapter 15.

    The traditional character-input functions are a superset of the character
    I/O functions that were present in CP/M. Originally included in MS-DOS
    simply to facilitate the porting of existing applications from CP/M, they
    are still widely used. In MS-DOS versions 2.0 and later, most of the
    traditional functions also support I/O redirection (although not as well
    as the handle functions do).

    Use of the IBM ROM BIOS keyboard functions presupposes that the program is
    running on an IBM PC─compatible machine. The ROM BIOS keyboard driver
    operates at a much more primitive level than the MS-DOS functions and
    allows a program to circumvent I/O redirection or MS-DOS's special
    handling of certain control characters. Programs that use the ROM BIOS
    keyboard driver are inherently less portable than those that use the
    MS-DOS functions and may interfere with the proper operation of other
    programs; many of the popular terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) utilities
    fall into this category.

Keyboard Input with Handles

    The principal MS-DOS function for keyboard input using handles is Int 21H
    Function 3FH (Read File or Device). The parameters for this function are
    a handle, the segment and offset of a buffer, and the length of the
    buffer. (For a more detailed explanation of this function, see Section
    II of this book, "MS-DOS Functions Reference.")

    As an example, let's use the predefined standard input handle (0) and Int
    21H Function 3FH to read a line from the keyboard:

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    buffer  db   80 dup (?)     ; keyboard input buffer
            .
            .
            .
            mov  ah,3fh         ; function 3fh = read file or device
            mov  bx,0           ; handle for standard input
            mov  cx,80          ; maximum bytes to read
            mov  dx,seg buffer  ; DS:DX = buffer address
            mov  ds,dx
            mov  dx,offset buffer
            int  21h            ; transfer to MS-DOS
            jc   error          ; jump if error detected
            .
            .
            .
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    When control returns from Int 21H Function 3FH, the carry flag is clear if
    the function was successful, and AX contains the number of characters
    read. If there was an error, the carry flag is set and AX contains an
    error code; however, this should never occur when reading the keyboard.

    The standard input is redirectable, so the code just shown is not a
    foolproof way of obtaining input from the keyboard. Depending upon whether
    a redirection parameter was included in the command line by the user,
    program input might be coming from the keyboard, a file, another character
    device, or even the bit bucket (NUL device). To bypass redirection and be
    absolutely certain where your input is coming from, you can ignore the
    predefined standard input handle and open the console as though it were a
    file, using the handle obtained from that open operation to perform your
    keyboard input, as in the following example:

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    buffer  db     80 dup (?)   ; keyboard input buffer
    fname   db     'CON',0      ; keyboard device name
    handle  dw     0            ; keyboard device handle
            .
            .
            .
            mov    ah,3dh       ; function 3dh = open
            mov    al,0         ; mode = read
            mov    dx,seg fname ; DS:DX = device name
            mov    ds,dx
            mov    dx,offset fname
            int    21h          ; transfer to MS-DOS
            jc     error        ; jump if open failed
            mov    handle,ax    ; save handle for CON
            .
            .
            .
            mov    ah,3fh       ; function 3fh = read file or device
            mov    bx,handle    ; BX = handle for CON
            mov    cx,80        ; maximum bytes to read
            mov    dx,offset buffer ; DS:DX = buffer address
            int    21h          ; transfer to MS-DOS
            jc     error        ; jump if error detected
            .
            .
            .
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    When a programmer uses Int 21H Function 3FH to read from the keyboard, the
    exact result depends on whether MS-DOS regards the handle to be in ASCII
    mode or binary mode (sometimes known as cooked mode and raw mode). ASCII
    mode is the default, although binary mode can be selected with Int 21H
    Function 44H (IOCTL) when necessary.

    In ASCII mode, MS-DOS initially places characters obtained from the
    keyboard in a 128-byte internal buffer, and the user can edit the input
    with the Backspace key and the special function keys. MS-DOS automatically
    echoes the characters to the standard output, expanding tab characters to
    spaces (although they are left as the ASCII code 09H in the buffer). The
    Ctrl-C, Ctrl-S, and Ctrl-P key combinations receive special handling, and
    the Enter key is translated to a carriage return─linefeed pair. When the
    user presses Enter or Ctrl-Z, MS-DOS copies the requested number of
    characters (or the actual number of characters entered, if less than the
    number requested) out of the internal buffer into the calling program's
    buffer.

    In binary mode, MS-DOS never echoes input characters. It passes the
    Ctrl-C, Ctrl-S, Ctrl-P, and Ctrl-Z key combinations and the Enter key
    through to the application unchanged, and Int 21H Function 3FH does not
    return control to the application until the exact number of characters
    requested has been received.

    Ctrl-C checking is discussed in more detail at the end of this chapter.
    For now, simply note that the application programmer can substitute a
    custom handler for the default MS-DOS Ctrl-C handler and thereby avoid
    having the application program lose control of the machine when the user
    enters a Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Break.

Keyboard Input with Traditional Calls

    The MS-DOS traditional keyboard functions offer a variety of character and
    line-oriented services with or without echo and Ctrl-C detection. These
    functions are summarized on the following page.

    Int 21H Function   Action                               Ctrl-C checking
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    01H               Keyboard input with echo             Yes
    06H               Direct console I/O                   No
    07H               Keyboard input without echo          No
    08H               Keyboard input without echo          Yes
    0AH               Buffered keyboard input              Yes
    0BH               Input-status check                   Yes
    0CH               Input-buffer reset and input         Varies
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    In MS-DOS versions 2.0 and later, redirection of the standard input
    affects all these functions. In other words, they act as though they were
    special cases of an Int 21H Function 3FH call using the predefined
    standard input handle (0).

    The character-input functions (01H, 06H, 07H, and 08H) all return a
    character in the AL register. For example, the following sequence waits
    until a key is pressed and then returns it in AL:

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
            mov     ah,1        ; function 01h = read keyboard
            int     21h         ; transfer to MS-DOS
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    The character-input functions differ in whether the input is echoed to the
    screen and whether they are sensitive to Ctrl-C interrupts. Although
    MS-DOS provides no pure keyboard-status function that is immune to Ctrl-C,
    a program can read keyboard status (somewhat circuitously) without
    interference by using Int 21H Function 06H. Extended keys, such as the
    IBM PC keyboard's special function keys, require two calls to a
    character-input function.

    As an alternative to single-character input, a program can use
    buffered-line input (Int 21H Function 0AH) to obtain an entire line from
    the keyboard in one operation. MS-DOS builds up buffered lines in an
    internal buffer and does not pass them to the calling program until the
    user presses the Enter key. While the line is being entered, all the usual
    editing keys are active and are handled by the MS-DOS keyboard driver. You
    use Int 21H Function 0AH as follows:

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    buff    db      81          ; maximum length of input
            db      0           ; actual length (from MS-DOS)
            db      81 dup (0)  ; receives keyboard input
            .
            .
            .
            mov     ah,0ah      ; function 0ah = read buffered line
            mov     dx,seg buff ; DS:DX = buffer address
            mov     ds,dx
            mov     dx,offset buff
            int     21h         ; transfer to MS-DOS
            .
            .
            .
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Int 21H Function 0AH differs from Int 21H Function 3FH in several
    important ways. First, the maximum length is passed in the first byte of
    the buffer, rather than in the CX register. Second, the actual length is
    returned in the second byte of the structure, rather than in the AX
    register. Finally, when the user has entered one less than the specified
    maximum number of characters, MS-DOS ignores all subsequent characters and
    sounds a warning beep until the Enter key is pressed.

    For detailed information about each of the traditional keyboard-input
    functions, see Section II of this book, "MS-DOS Functions Reference."

Keyboard Input with ROM BIOS Functions

    Programmers writing applications for IBM PC compatibles can bypass the
    MS-DOS keyboard functions and choose from two hardware-dependent
    techniques for keyboard input.

    The first method is to call the ROM BIOS keyboard driver using Int 16H.
    For example, the following sequence reads a single character from the
    keyboard input buffer and returns it in the AL register:

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
            mov    ah,0         ; function 0=read keyboard
            int    16h          ; transfer to ROM BIOS
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Int 16H Function 00H also returns the keyboard scan code in the AH
    register, allowing the program to detect key codes that are not ordinarily
    returned by MS-DOS. Other Int 16H services return the keyboard status
    (that is, whether a character is waiting) or the keyboard shift state
    (from the ROM BIOS data area 0000:0417H). For a more detailed explanation
    of ROM BIOS keyboard functions, see Section III of this book, "IBM ROM
    BIOS and Mouse Functions Reference."

    You should consider carefully before building ROM BIOS dependence into an
    application. Although this technique allows you to bypass any I/O
    redirection that may be in effect, ways exist to do this without
    introducing dependence on the ROM BIOS. And there are real disadvantages
    to calling the ROM BIOS keyboard driver:

    ■  It always bypasses I/O redirection, which sometimes may not be
        desirable.

    ■  It is dependent on IBM PC compatibility and does not work correctly,
        unchanged, on some older machines such as the Hewlett-Packard
        TouchScreen or the Wang Professional Computer.

    ■  It may introduce complicated interactions with TSR utilities.

    The other and more hardware-dependent method of keyboard input on an IBM
    PC is to write a new handler for ROM BIOS Int 09H and service the keyboard
    controller's interrupts directly. This involves translation of scan codes
    to ASCII characters and maintenance of the type-ahead buffer. In ordinary
    PC applications, there is no reason to take over keyboard I/O at this
    level; therefore, I will not discuss this method further here. If you are
    curious about the techniques that would be required, the best reference is
    the listing for the ROM BIOS Int 09H handler in the IBM PC or PC/AT
    technical reference manual.


Ctrl-C and Ctrl-Break Handlers

    In the discussion of keyboard input with the MS-DOS handle and traditional
    functions, I made some passing references to the fact that Ctrl-C entries
    can interfere with the expected behavior of those functions. Let's look at
    this subject in more detail now.

    During most character I/O operations, MS-DOS checks for a Ctrl-C (ASCII
    code 03H) waiting at the keyboard and executes an Int 23H if one is
    detected. If the system break flag is on, MS-DOS also checks for a Ctrl-C
    entry during certain other operations (such as file reads and writes).
    Ordinarily, the Int 23H vector points to a routine that simply terminates
    the currently active process and returns control to the parent process──
    usually the MS-DOS command interpreter.

    In other words, if your program is executing and you enter a Ctrl-C,
    accidentally or intentionally, MS-DOS simply aborts the program. Any files
    the program has opened using file control blocks will not be closed
    properly, any interrupt vectors it has altered may not be restored
    correctly, and if it is performing any direct I/O operations (for example,
    if it contains an interrupt driver for the serial port), all kinds of
    unexpected events may occur.

    Although you can use a number of partially effective methods to defeat
    Ctrl-C checking, such as performing keyboard input with Int 21H Functions
    06H and 07H, placing all character devices into binary mode, or turning
    off the system break flag with Int 21H Function 33H, none of these is
    completely foolproof. The simplest and most elegant way to defeat Ctrl-C
    checking is simply to substitute your own Int 23H handler, which can take
    some action appropriate to your program. When the program terminates,
    MS-DOS automatically restores the previous contents of the Int 23H vector
    from information saved in the program segment prefix. The following
    example shows how to install your own Ctrl-C handler (which in this case
    does nothing at all):

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
            push    ds          ; save data segment
                                ; set int 23h vector...
            mov     ax,2523h    ; function 25h = set interrupt
                                ; int 23h = vector for
                                ; Ctrl-C handler
            mov     dx,seg handler ; DS:DX = handler address
            mov     ds,dx
            mov     dx,offset handler
            int     21h         ; transfer to MS-DOS

            pop     ds          ; restore data segment
            .
            .
            .
    handler:                    ; a Ctrl-C handler
            iret                ; that does nothing
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    The first part of the code (which alters the contents of the Int 23H
    vector) would be executed in the initialization part of the application.
    The handler receives control whenever MS-DOS detects a Ctrl-C at the
    keyboard. (Because this handler consists only of an interrupt return, the
    Ctrl-C will remain in the keyboard input stream and will be passed to the
    application when it requests a character from the keyboard, appearing on
    the screen as ^C.)

    When an Int 23H handler is called, MS-DOS is in a stable state. Thus, the
    handler can call any MS-DOS function. It can also reset the segment
    registers and the stack pointer and transfer control to some other point
    in the application without ever returning control to MS-DOS with an IRET.

    On IBM PC compatibles, an additional interrupt handler must be taken into
    consideration. Whenever the ROM BIOS keyboard driver detects the key
    combination Ctrl-Break, it calls a handler whose address is stored in the
    vector for Int 1BH. The default ROM BIOS Int 1BH handler does nothing.
    MS-DOS alters the Int 1BH vector to point to its own handler, which sets a
    flag and returns; the net effect is to remap the Ctrl-Break into a Ctrl-C
    that is forced ahead of any other characters waiting in the keyboard
    buffer.

    Taking over the Int 1BH vector in an application is somewhat tricky but
    extremely useful. Because the keyboard is interrupt driven, a press of
    Ctrl-Break lets the application regain control under almost any
    circumstance──often, even if the program has crashed or is in an endless
    loop.

    You cannot, in general, use the same handler for Int 1BH that you use for
    Int 23H. The Int 1BH handler is more limited in what it can do, because it
    has been called as a result of a hardware interrupt and MS-DOS may have
    been executing a critical section of code at the time the interrupt was
    serviced. Thus, all registers except CS:IP are in an unknown state; they
    may have to be saved and then modified before your interrupt handler can
    execute. Similarly, the depth of the stack in use when the Int 1BH handler
    is called is unknown, and if the handler is to perform stack-intensive
    operations, it may have to save the stack segment and the stack pointer
    and switch to a new stack that is known to have sufficient depth.

    In normal application programs, you should probably avoid retaining
    control in an Int 1BH handler, rather than performing an IRET. Because of
    subtle differences among non-IBM ROM BIOSes, it is difficult to predict
    the state of the keyboard controller and the 8259 Programmable Interrupt
    Controller (PIC) when the Int 1BH handler begins executing. Also, MS-DOS
    itself may not be in a stable state at the point of interrupt, a situation
    that can manifest itself in unexpected critical errors during subsequent
    I/O operations. Finally, MS-DOS versions 3.2 and later allocate a stack
    from an internal pool for use by the Int 09H handler. If the Int 1BH
    handler never returns, the Int 09H handler never returns either, and
    repeated entries of Ctrl-Break will eventually exhaust the stack pool,
    halting the system.

    Because Int 1BH is a ROM BIOS interrupt and not an MS-DOS interrupt,
    MS-DOS does not restore the previous contents of the Int 1BH vector when a
    program exits. If your program modifies this vector, it must save the
    original value and restore it before terminating. Otherwise, the vector
    will be left pointing to some random area in the next program that runs,
    and the next time the user presses Ctrl-Break a system crash is the best
    you can hope for.

Ctrl-C and Ctrl-Break Handlers and High-Level Languages

    Capturing the Ctrl-C and Ctrl-Break interrupts is straightforward when you
    are programming in assembly language. The process is only slightly more
    difficult with high-level languages, as long as you have enough
    information about the language's calling conventions that you can link in
    a small assembly-language routine as part of the program.

    The BREAK.ASM listing in Figure 5-1 contains source code for a Ctrl-Break
    handler that can be linked with small-model Microsoft C programs running
    on an IBM PC compatible. The short C program in Figure 5-2 demonstrates
    use of the handler. (This code should be readily portable to other C
    compilers.)

    ; and assumes the C small memory model.
    ;
    ; The procedure _capture is called to install
    ; a new handler for the Ctrl-C and Ctrl-Break
    ; interrupts (1bh and 23h).  _capture is passed
    ; the address of a static variable, which will be
    ; set to true by the handler whenever a Ctrl-C
    ; or Ctrl-Break is detected.  The C syntax is:
    ;
    ;               static int flag;
    ;               capture(&amp;flag);
    ;
    ; The procedure _release is called by the C program
    ; to restore the original Ctrl-Break and Ctrl-C
    ; handler. The C syntax is:
    ;               release();
    ;
    ; The procedure ctrlbrk is the actual interrupt
    ; handler.  It receives control when a software
    ; int 1bh is executed by the ROM BIOS or int 23h
    ; is executed by MS-DOS.  It simply sets the C
    ; program's variable to true (1) and returns.

    Figure 5-2.  TRYBREAK.C: A simple Microsoft C program that demonstrates
    use of the interrupt handler BREAK.ASM from Figure 5-1.

    In the example handler, the procedure named capture is called with the
    address of an integer variable within the C program. It saves the address
    of the variable, points the Int 1BH and Int 23H vectors to its own
    interrupt handler, and then returns.

    When MS-DOS detects a Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Break, the interrupt handler sets the
    integer variable within the C program to true (1) and returns. The C
    program can then poll this variable at its leisure. Of course, to detect
    more than one Ctrl-C, the program must reset the variable to zero again.

    The procedure named release simply restores the Int 1BH and Int 23H
    vectors to their original values, thereby disabling the interrupt handler.
    Although it is not strictly necessary for release to do anything about Int
    23H, this action does give the C program the option of restoring the
    default handler for Int 23H without terminating.


Pointing Devices

    Device drivers for pointing devices are supplied by the hardware
    manufacturer and are loaded with a DEVICE statement in the CONFIG.SYS
    file. Although the hardware characteristics of the available pointing
    devices differ greatly, nearly all of their drivers present the same
    software interface to application programs: the Int 33H protocol used by
    the Microsoft Mouse driver. Version 6 of the Microsoft Mouse driver (which
    was current as this was written) offers the following functions:

    Although this list of mouse functions may appear intimidating, the average
    application will only need a few of them.

    A program first calls Int 33H Function 00H to initialize the mouse driver
    for the current display mode and to check its status. At this point, the
    mouse is "alive" and the application can obtain its state and position;
    however, the pointer does not become visible until the process calls Int
    33H Function 01H.

    The program can then call Int 33H Functions 03H, 05H, and 06H to
    monitor the mouse position and the status of the mouse buttons.
    Alternatively, the program can register an interrupt handler for mouse
    events, using Int 33H Function 0CH. This latter technique eliminates the
    need to poll the mouse driver; the driver will notify the program by
    calling the interrupt handler whenever the mouse is moved or a button is
    pressed or released.

    When the application is finished with the mouse, it can call Int 33H
    Function 02H to hide the mouse pointer. If the program has registered an
    interrupt handler for mouse events, it should disable further calls to the
    handler by resetting the mouse driver again with Int 33H Function 00H.

    For a complete description of the mouse-driver functions, see Section
    III of this book, "IBM ROM BIOS and Mouse Functions Reference." Figure
    5-3 shows a small demonstration program that polls the mouse continually,
    to display its position and status.

Chapter 6  Video Display

    The visual presentation of an application program is one of its most
    important elements. Users frequently base their conclusions about a
    program's performance and "polish" on the speed and attractiveness of its
    displays. Therefore, a feel for the computer system's display facilities
    and capabilities at all levels, from MS-DOS down to the bare hardware, is
    important to you as a programmer.


Video Display Adapters

    The video display adapters found in IBM PC─compatible computers have a
    hybrid interface to the central processor. The overall display
    characteristics, such as vertical and horizontal resolution, background
    color, and palette, are controlled by values written to I/O ports whose
    addresses are hardwired on the adapter, whereas the appearance of each
    individual character or graphics pixel on the display is controlled by a
    specific location within an area of memory called the regen buffer or
    refresh buffer. Both the CPU and the video controller access this memory;
    the software updates the display by simply writing character codes or bit
    patterns directly into the regen buffer. (This is called memory-mapped
    I/O.)

    The following adapters are in common use as this book is being written:

    ■  Monochrome/Printer Display Adapter (MDA). Introduced with the original
        IBM PC in 1981, this adapter supports 80-by-25 text display on a green
        (monochrome) screen and has no graphics capabilities at all.

    ■  Color/Graphics Adapter (CGA). Also introduced by IBM in 1981, this
        adapter supports 40-by-25 and 80-by-25 text modes and 320-by-200,
        4-color or 640-by-200, 2-color graphics (all-points-addressable, or
        APA) modes on composite or digital RGB monitors.

    ■  Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA). Introduced by IBM in 1985 and upwardly
        compatible from the CGA, this adapter adds support for 640-by-350,
        16-color graphics modes on digital RGB monitors. It also supports an
        MDA-compatible text mode.

    ■  Multi-Color Graphics Array (MCGA). Introduced by IBM in 1987 with the
        Personal System/2 (PS/2) models 25 and 30, this adapter is partially
        compatible with the CGA and EGA and supports 640-by-480, 2-color or
        320-by-200, 256-color graphics on analog RGB monitors.

    ■  Video Graphics Array (VGA). Introduced by IBM in 1987 with the PS/2
        models 50, 60, and 80, this adapter is upwardly compatible from the EGA
        and supports 640-by-480, 16-color or 320-by-200, 256-color graphics on
        analog RGB monitors. It also supports an MDA-compatible text mode.

    ■  Hercules Graphics Card, Graphics CardPlus, and InColor Cards. These are
        upwardly compatible from the MDA for text display but offer graphics
        capabilities that are incompatible with all of the IBM adapters.

    The locations of the regen buffers for the various IBM PC─compatible
    adapters are shown in Figure 6-1.

Support Considerations

    MS-DOS offers several functions to transfer text to the display. Version 1
    supported only Teletype-like output capabilities; version 2 added an
    optional ANSI console driver to allow the programmer to clear the screen,
    position the cursor, and select colors and attributes with standard escape
    sequences embedded in the output. Programs that use only the MS-DOS
    functions will operate properly on any computer system that runs MS-DOS,
    regardless of the level of IBM hardware compatibility.

    On IBM PC─compatible machines, the ROM BIOS contains a video driver that
    programs can invoke directly, bypassing MS-DOS. The ROM BIOS functions
    allow a program to write text or individual pixels to the screen or to
    select display modes, video pages, palette, and foreground and background
    colors. These functions are relatively efficient (compared with the MS-DOS
    functions, at least), although the graphics support is primitive.

    Unfortunately, the display functions of both MS-DOS and the ROM BIOS were
    designed around the model of a cursor-addressable terminal and therefore
    do not fully exploit the capabilities of the memory-mapped, high-bandwidth
    display adapters used on IBM PC─compatible machines. As a result, nearly
    every popular interactive application with full-screen displays or
    graphics capability ignores both MS-DOS and the ROM BIOS and writes
    directly to the video controller's registers and regen buffer.

    Programs that control the hardware directly are sometimes called
    "ill-behaved," because they are performing operations that are normally
    reserved for operating-system device drivers. These programs are a severe
    management problem in multitasking real-mode environments such as DesqView
    and Microsoft Windows, and they are the main reason why such environments
    are not used more widely. It could be argued, however, that the blame for
    such problematic behavior lies not with the application programs but with
    the failure of MS-DOS and the ROM BIOS──even six years after the first
    appearance of the IBM PC──to provide display functions of adequate range
    and power.


MS-DOS Display Functions

    Under MS-DOS versions 2.0 and later, the preferred method for sending text
    to the display is to use handle-based Int 21H Function 40H (Write File or
    Device). When an application program receives control, MS-DOS has already
    assigned it handles for the standard output (1) and standard error (2)
    devices, and these handles can be used immediately. For example, the
    sequence at the top of the following page writes the message hello to the
    display using the standard output handle.

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    msg     db      'hello'     ; message to display
    msg_len equ     $-msg       ; length of message
            .
            .
            .
            mov     ah,40h      ; function 40h = write file or device
            mov     bx,1        ; BX = standard output handle
            mov     cx,msg_len  ; CX = message length
            mov     dx,seg msg  ; DS:DX = address of message
            mov     ds,dx
            mov     dx,offset msg
            int     21h         ; transfer to MS-DOS
            jc      error       ; jump if error detected
            .
            .
            .
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    If there is no error, the function returns the carry flag cleared and the
    number of characters actually transferred in register AX. Unless a Ctrl-Z
    is embedded in the text or the standard output is redirected to a disk
    file and the disk is full, this number should equal the number of
    characters requested.

    As in the case of keyboard input, the user's ability to specify
    command-line redirection parameters that are invisible to the application
    means that if you use the predefined standard output handle, you can't
    always be sure where your output is going. However, to ensure that your
    output actually goes to the display, you can use the predefined standard
    error handle, which is always opened to the CON (logical console) device
    and is not redirectable.

    As an alternative to the standard output and standard error handles, you
    can bypass any output redirection and open a separate channel to CON,
    using the handle obtained from that open operation for character output.
    For example, the following code opens the console display for output and
    then writes the string hello to it:

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    fname   db      'CON',0      ; name of CON device
    handle  dw      0            ; handle for CON device
    msg     db      'hello'      ; message to display
    msg_len equ     $-msg        ; length of message
            .
            .
            .
            mov     ax,3d02h     ; AH = function 3dh = open
                                ; AL = mode = read/write
            mov     dx,seg fname ; DS:DX = device name
            mov     ds,dx
            mov     dx,offset fname
            int     21h          ; transfer to MS-DOS
            jc      error        ; jump if open failed
            mov     handle,ax    ; save handle for CON
            .
            .
            .
            mov     ah,40h       ; function 40h = write
            mov     cx,msg_len   ; CX = message length
            mov     dx,seg msg   ; DS:DX = address of message
            mov     ds,dx
            mov     dx,offset msg
            mov     bx,handle    ; BX = CON device handle
            int     21h          ; transfer to MS-DOS
            jc      error        ; jump if error detected
            .
            .
            .
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    As with the keyboard input functions, MS-DOS also supports traditional
    display functions that are upwardly compatible from the corresponding CP/M
    output calls:

    ■  Int 21H Function 02H sends the character in the DL register to the
        standard output device. It is sensitive to Ctrl-C interrupts, and it
        handles carriage returns, linefeeds, bell codes, and backspaces
        appropriately.

    ■  Int 21H Function 06H transfers the character in the DL register to the
        standard output device, but it is not sensitive to Ctrl-C interrupts.
        You must take care when using this function, because it can also be
        used for input and for status requests.

    ■  Int 21H Function 09H sends a string to the standard output device. The
        string is terminated by the $ character.

    With MS-DOS version 2 or later, these three traditional functions are
    converted internally to handle-based writes to the standard output and
    thus are susceptible to output redirection.

    The sequence at the top of the following page sounds a warning beep by
    sending an ASCII bell code (07H) to the display driver using the
    traditional character-output call Int 21H Function 02H.

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
            .
            .
            .
            mov     dl,7        ; 07h = ASCII bell code
            mov     ah,2        ; function 02h = display character
            int     21h         ; transfer to MS-DOS
            .
            .
            .
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    The following sequence uses the traditional string-output call Int 21H
    Function 09H to display a string:

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    msg     db      'hello$'
            .
            .
            .
            mov     dx,seg msg  ; DS:DX = message address
            mov     ds,dx
            mov     dx,offset msg
            mov     ah,9        ; function 09h = write string
            int     21h         ; transfer to MS-DOS
            .
            .
            .
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Note that MS-DOS detects the $ character as a terminator and does not
    display it on the screen.

Screen Control with MS-DOS Functions

    With version 2.0 or later, if MS-DOS loads the optional device driver
    ANSI.SYS in response to a DEVICE directive in the CONFIG.SYS file,
    programs can clear the screen, control the cursor position, and select
    foreground and background colors by embedding escape sequences in the text
    output. Escape sequences are so called because they begin with an escape
    character (1BH), which alerts the driver to intercept and interpret the
    subsequent characters in the sequence. When the ANSI driver is not loaded,
    MS-DOS simply passes the escape sequence to the display like any other
    text, usually resulting in a chaotic screen.

    The escape sequences that can be used with the ANSI driver for screen
    control are a subset of those defined in the ANSI 3.64─1979 Standard.
    These standard sequences are summarized in Figure 6-2. Note that case is
    significant for the last character in an escape sequence and that numbers
    must always be represented as ASCII digit strings, not as their binary
    values. (A separate set of escape sequences supported by ANSI.SYS, but not
    compatible with the ANSI standard, may be used for reprogramming and
    remapping the keyboard.)

    Figure 6-2.  The ANSI escape sequences supported by the MS-DOS ANSI.SYS
    driver. Programs running under MS-DOS 2.0 or later may use these
    functions, if ANSI.SYS is loaded, to control the appearance of the display
    in a hardware-independent manner. The symbol Esc indicates an ASCII escape
    code──a character with the value 1BH. Note that cursor positions in ANSI
    escape sequences are one-based, unlike the cursor coordinates used by the
    IBM ROM BIOS, which are zero-based. Numbers embedded in an escape sequence
    must always be represented as a string of ASCII digits, not as their
    binary values.

Binary Output Mode

    Under MS-DOS version 2 or later, you can substantially increase display
    speeds for well-behaved application programs without sacrificing hardware
    independence by selecting binary (raw) mode for the standard output. In
    binary mode, MS-DOS does not check between each character it transfers to
    the output device for a Ctrl-C waiting at the keyboard, nor does it filter
    the output string for certain characters such as Ctrl-Z.

    Bit 5 in the device information word associated with a device handle
    controls binary mode. Programs access the device information word by using
    Subfunctions 00H and 01H of the MS-DOS IOCTL function (I/O Control, Int
    21H Function 44H). For example, the sequence on the following page places
    the standard output handle into binary mode.

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                ; get device information...
            mov     bx,1        ; standard output handle
            mov     ax,4400h    ; function 44h subfunction 00h
            int     21h         ; transfer to MS-DOS

            mov     dh,0        ; set upper byte of DX = 0
            or      dl,20h      ; set binary mode bit in DL

                                ; write device information...
                                ; (BX still has handle)
            mov     ax,4401h    ; function 44h subfunction 01h
            int     21h         ; transfer to MS-DOS
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Note that if a program changes the mode of any of the standard handles, it
    should restore those handles to ASCII (cooked) mode before it exits.
    Otherwise, subsequent application programs may behave in unexpected ways.
    For more detailed information on the IOCTL function, see Section II of
    this book, "MS-DOS Functions Reference."


The ROM BIOS Display Functions

    You can somewhat improve the display performance of programs that are
    intended for use only on IBM PC─compatible machines by using the ROM BIOS
    video driver instead of the MS-DOS output functions. Accessed by means of
    Int 10H, the ROM BIOS driver supports the following functions for all of
    the currently available IBM display adapters:

╓┌─┌──────────────────┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────╖
    Function           Action

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


    Additional ROM BIOS functions are available on the EGA, MCGA, VGA, and
    PCjr to support the enhanced features of these adapters, such as
    programmable palettes and character sets (fonts). Some of the functions
    are valid only in certain display modes.

    Each display mode is characterized by the number of colors it can display,
    its vertical resolution, its horizontal resolution, and whether it
    supports text or graphics memory mapping. The ROM BIOS identifies it with
    a unique number. Section III of this book, "IBM ROM BIOS and Mouse
    Functions Reference," documents all of the ROM BIOS Int 10H functions and
    display modes.

    As you can see from the preceding list, the ROM BIOS offers several
    desirable capabilities that are not available from MS-DOS, including
    initialization or scrolling of selected screen windows, modification of
    the cursor shape, and reading back the character being displayed at an
    arbitrary screen location. These functions can be used to isolate your
    program from the hardware on any IBM PC─compatible adapter. However, the
    ROM BIOS functions do not suffice for the needs of a high-performance,
    interactive, full-screen program such as a word processor. They do not
    support the rapid display of character strings at an arbitrary screen
    position, and they do not implement graphics operations at the level
    normally required by applications (for example, bit-block transfers and
    rapid drawing of lines, circles, and filled polygons). And, of course,
    they are of no use whatsoever in non-IBM display modes such as the
    monochrome graphics mode of the Hercules Graphics Card.

    Let's look at a simple example of a call to the ROM BIOS video driver. The
    following sequence writes the string hello to the screen:

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    msg     db      'hello'
    msg_len equ     $-msg
            .
            .
            .
            mov     si,seg msg  ; DS:SI = message address
            mov     ds,si
            mov     si,offset msg
            mov     cx,msg_len  ; CX = message length
            cld
    next:   lodsb               ; get AL = next character
            push    si          ; save message pointer
            mov     ah,0eh      ; int 10h function 0eh = write
                                ; character in teletype mode
            mov     bh,0        ; assume video page 0
            mov     bl,color    ; (use in graphics modes only)
            int     10h         ; transfer to ROM BIOS
            pop     si          ; restore message pointer
            loop    next        ; loop until message done
            .
            .
            .
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    (Note that the SI and DI registers are not necessarily preserved across a
    call to a ROM BIOS video function.)


Memory-mapped Display Techniques

    Display performance is best when an application program takes over
    complete control of the video adapter and the refresh buffer. Because the
    display is memory-mapped, the speed at which characters can be put on the
    screen is limited only by the CPU's ability to copy bytes from one
    location in memory to another. The trade-off for this performance is that
    such programs are highly sensitive to hardware compatibility and do not
    always function properly on "clones" or even on new models of IBM video
    adapters.

Text Mode

    Direct programming of the IBM PC─compatible video adapters in their text
    display modes (sometimes also called alphanumeric display modes) is
    straightforward. The character set is the same for all, and the cursor
    home position──(x,y) = (0,0)──is defined to be the upper left corner of
    the screen (Figure 6-3). The MDA uses 4 KB of memory starting at segment
    B000H as a regen buffer, and the various adapters with both text and
    graphics capabilities (CGA, EGA, MCGA, and VGA) use 16 KB of memory
    starting at segment B800H. (See Figure 6-1.) In the latter case, the 16
    KB is divided into "pages" that can be independently updated and
    displayed.

    BIOS modes 2, 3, and 7).

    Each character-display position is allotted 2 bytes in the regen buffer.
    The first byte (even address) contains the ASCII code of the character,
    which is translated by a special hardware character generator into a
    dot-matrix pattern for the screen. The second byte (odd address) is the
    attribute byte. Several bit fields in this byte control such features as
    blinking, intensity (highlighting), and reverse video, depending on the
    adapter type and display mode (Figures 6-4 and 6-5). Figure 6-6 shows a
    hex and ASCII dump of part of the video map for the MDA.

    Figure 6-6.  Example dump of the first 160 bytes of the MDA's regen
    buffer. These bytes correspond to the first visible line on the screen.
    Note that ASCII character codes are stored in even bytes and their
    respective character attributes in odd bytes; all the characters in this
    example line have the attribute normal video.

    You can calculate the memory offset of any character on the display as the
    line number (y coordinate) times 80 characters per line times 2 bytes per
    character, plus the column number (x coordinate) times 2 bytes per
    character, plus (for the text/graphics adapters) the page number times the
    size of the page (4 KB per page in 80-by-25 modes; 2 KB per page in
    40-by-25 modes). In short, the formula for the offset of the
    character-attribute pair for a given screen position (x,y) in 80-by-25
    text modes is

    offset = ((y * 50H + x) * 2) + (page * 1000H)

    In 40-by-25 text modes, the formula is

    offset = ((y * 50H + x) * 2) + (page * 0800H)

    Of course, the segment register being used to address the video buffer
    must be set appropriately, depending on the type of display adapter.

    As a simple example, assume that the character to be displayed is in the
    AL register, the desired attribute byte for the character is in the AH
    register, the x coordinate (column) is in the BX register, and the y
    coordinate (row) is in the CX register. The following code stores the
    character and attribute byte into the MDA's video refresh buffer at the
    proper location:

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
            push    ax          ; save char and attribute
            mov     ax,160
            mul     cx          ; DX:AX = Y * 160
            shl     bx,1        ; multiply X by 2
            add     bx,ax       ; BX = (Y*160) + (X*2)
            mov     ax,0b000h   ; ES = segment of monochrome
            mov     es,ax       ; adapter refresh buffer
            pop     ax          ; restore char and attribute
            mov     es:[bx],ax  ; write them to video buffer
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    More frequently, we wish to move entire strings into the refresh buffer,
    starting at a given coordinate. In the next example, assume that the DS:SI
    registers point to the source string, the ES:DI registers point to the
    starting position in the video buffer (calculated as shown in the previous
    example), the AH register contains the attribute byte to be assigned to
    every character in the string, and the CX register contains the length of
    the string. The following code moves the entire string into the refresh
    buffer:

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    xfer:   lodsb               ; fetch next character
            stosw               ; store char + attribute
            loop    xfer        ; until all chars moved
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Of course, the video drivers written for actual application programs must
    take into account many additional factors, such as checking for special
    control codes (linefeeds, carriage returns, tabs), line wrap, and
    scrolling.

    Programs that write characters directly to the CGA regen buffer in text
    modes must deal with an additional complicating factor──they must examine
    the video controller's status port and access the refresh buffer only
    during the horizontal retrace or vertical retrace intervals. (A retrace
    interval is the period when the electron beam that illuminates the screen
    phosphors is being repositioned to the start of a new scan line.)
    Otherwise, the contention for memory between the CPU and the video
    controller is manifest as unsightly "snow" on the display. (If you are
    writing programs for any of the other IBM PC─compatible video adapters,
    such as the MDA, EGA, MCGA, or VGA, you can ignore the retrace intervals;
    snow is not a problem with these video controllers.)

    A program can detect the occurrence of a retrace interval by monitoring
    certain bits in the video controller's status register. For example,
    assume that the offset for the desired character position has been
    calculated as in the preceding example and placed in the BX register, the
    segment for the CGA's refresh buffer is in the ES register, and an ASCII
    character code to be displayed is in the CL register. The following code
    waits for the beginning of a new horizontal retrace interval and then
    writes the character into the buffer:

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
            mov     dx,03dah    ; DX = video controller's
                                ; status port address
            cli                 ; disable interrupts

                                ; if retrace is already
                                ; in progress, wait for
                                ; it to end...
    wait1:  in      al,dx       ; read status port
            and     al,1        ; check if retrace bit on
            jnz     wait1       ; yes, wait

                                ; wait for new retrace
                                ; interval to start...
    wait2:  in      al,dx       ; read status port
            and     al,1        ; retrace bit on yet?
            jz      wait2       ; jump if not yet on

            mov     es:[bx],cl  ; write character to
                                ; the regen buffer
            sti                 ; enable interrupts again
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    The first wait loop "synchronizes" the code to the beginning of a
    horizontal retrace interval. If only the second wait loop were used (that
    is, if a character were written when a retrace interval was already in
    progress), the write would occasionally begin so close to the end of a
    horizontal retrace "window" that it would partially miss the retrace,
    resulting in scattered snow at the left edge of the display. Notice that
    the code also disables interrupts during accesses to the video buffer, so
    that service of a hardware interrupt won't disrupt the synchronization
    process.

    Because of the retrace-interval constraints just outlined, the rate at
    which you can update the CGA in text modes is severely limited when the
    updating is done one character at a time. You can obtain better results by
    calculating all the relevant addresses and setting up the appropriate
    registers, disabling the video controller by writing to register 3D8H,
    moving the entire string to the buffer with a REP MOVSW operation, and
    then reenabling the video controller. If the string is of reasonable
    length, the user won't even notice a flicker in the display. Of course,
    this procedure introduces additional hardware dependence into your code
    because it requires much greater knowledge of the 6845 controller.
    Luckily, snow is not a problem in CGA graphics modes.

Graphics Mode

    Graphics-mode memory-mapped programming for IBM PC─compatible adapters is
    considerably more complicated than text-mode programming. Each bit or
    group of bits in the regen buffer corresponds to an addressable point, or
    pixel, on the screen. The mapping of bits to pixels differs for each of
    the available graphics modes, with their differences in resolution and
    number of supported colors. The newer adapters (EGA, MCGA, and VGA) also
    use the concept of bit planes, where bits of a pixel are segregated into
    multiple banks of memory mapped at the same address; you must manipulate
    these bit planes by a combination of memory-mapped I/O and port
    addressing.

    IBM-video-systems graphics programming is a subject large enough for a
    book of its own, but we can use the 640-by-200, 2-color graphics display
    mode of the CGA (which is also supported by all subsequent IBM
    text/graphics adapters) to illustrate a few of the techniques involved.
    This mode is simple to deal with because each pixel is represented by a
    single bit. The pixels are assigned (x,y) coordinates in the range (0,0)
    through (639,199), where x is the horizontal displacement, y is the
    vertical displacement, and the home position (0,0) is the upper left
    corner of the display. (See Figure 6-7.)

    Each successive group of 80 bytes (640 bits) represents one horizontal
    scan line. Within each byte, the bits map one-for-one onto pixels, with
    the most significant bit corresponding to the leftmost displayed pixel of
    a set of eight pixels and the least significant bit corresponding to the
    rightmost displayed pixel of the set. The memory map is set up so that all
    the even y coordinates are scanned as a set and all the odd y coordinates
    are scanned as a set; this mapping is referred to as the memory interlace.

    To find the regen buffer offset for a particular (x,y) coordinate, you
    would use the following formula:

    offset = ((y AND 1) * 2000H) + (y/2 * 50H) + (x/8)

    The assembly-language implementation of this formula is as follows:

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                ; assume AX = Y, BX = X
            shr     bx,1        ; divide X by 8
            shr     bx,1
            shr     bx,1
            push    ax          ; save copy of Y
            shr     ax,1        ; find (Y/2) * 50h
            mov     cx,50h      ; with product in DX:AX
            mul     cx
            add     bx,ax       ; add product to X/8
            pop     ax          ; add (Y AND 1) * 2000h
            and     ax,1
            jz      label1
            add     bx,2000h
    label1:                     ; now BX = offset into
                                ; video buffer
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    After calculating the correct byte address, you can use the following
    formula to calculate the bit position for a given pixel coordinate:

    bit = 7 - (x MOD 8)

    where bit 7 is the most significant bit and bit 0 is the least significant
    bit. It is easiest to build an 8-byte table, or array of bit masks, and
    use the operation X AND 7 to extract the appropriate entry from the table:

    (X AND 7)          Bit mask          (X AND 7)          Bit mask
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    0                  80H               4                  08H
    1                  40H               5                  04H
    2                  20H               6                  02H
    3                  10H               7                  01H
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    The assembly-language implementation of this second calculation is as
    follows:

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    table   db      80h         ; X AND 7 = offset 0
            db      40h         ; X AND 7 = offset 1
            db      20h         ; X AND 7 = offset 2
            db      10h         ; X AND 7 = offset 3
            db      08h         ; X AND 7 = offset 4
            db      04h         ; X AND 7 = offset 5
            db      02h         ; X AND 7 = offset 6
            db      01h         ; X AND 7 = offset 7
            .
            .
            .
                                ; assume BX = X coordinate
            and     bx,7        ; isolate 0─7 offset
            mov     al,[bx+table]
                                ; now AL = mask from table
            .
            .
            .
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    The program can then use the mask, together with the byte offset
    previously calculated, to set or clear the appropriate bit in the video
    controller's regen buffer.

Chapter 7  Printer and Serial Port

    MS-DOS supports printers, plotters, modems, and other hard-copy output or
    communication devices with device drivers for parallel ports and serial
    ports. Parallel ports are so named because they transfer a byte──8 bits──
    in parallel to the destination device over eight separate physical paths
    (plus additional status and handshaking signals). The serial port, on the
    other hand, communicates with the CPU with bytes but sends data to or
    receives data from its destination device serially──a bit at a time──over
    a single physical connection.

    Parallel ports are typically used for high-speed output devices, such as
    line printers, over relatively short distances (less than 50 feet). They
    are rarely used for devices that require two-way communication with the
    computer. Serial ports are used for lower-speed devices, such as modems
    and terminals, that require two-way communication (although some printers
    also have serial interfaces). A serial port can drive its device reliably
    over much greater distances (up to 1000 feet) over as few as three wires──
    transmit, receive, and ground.

    The most commonly used type of serial interface follows a standard called
    RS-232. This standard specifies a 25-wire interface with certain
    electrical characteristics, the use of various handshaking signals, and a
    standard DB-25 connector. Other serial-interface standards exist──for
    example, the RS-422, which is capable of considerably higher speeds than
    the RS-232── but these are rarely used in personal computers (except for
    the Apple Macintosh) at this time.

    MS-DOS has built-in device drivers for three parallel adapters, and for
    two serial adapters on the PC or PC/AT and three serial adapters on the
    PS/2. The logical names for these devices are LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, COM1,
    COM2, and COM3. The standard printer (PRN) and standard auxiliary (AUX)
    devices are normally aliased to LPT1 and COM1, but you can redirect PRN to
    one of the serial ports with the MS-DOS MODE command.

    As with keyboard and video display I/O, you can manage printer and
    serial-port I/O at several levels that offer different degrees of
    flexibility and hardware independence:

    ■  MS-DOS handle-oriented functions

    ■  MS-DOS traditional character functions

    ■  IBM ROM BIOS driver functions

    In the case of the serial port, direct control of the hardware by
    application programs is also common. I will discuss each of these I/O
    methods briefly, with examples, in the following pages.


Printer Output

    The preferred method of printer output is to use the handle write function
    (Int 21H Function 40H) with the predefined standard printer handle (4).
    For example, you could write the string hello to the printer as follows:

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    msg     db      'hello'     ; message for printer
    msg_len equ     $-msg       ; length of message
            .
            .
            .
            mov     ah,40h      ; function 40h = write file or device
            mov     bx,4        ; BX = standard printer handle
            mov     cx,msg_len  ; CX = length of string
            mov     dx,seg msg  ; DS:DX = string address
            mov     ds,dx
            mov     dx,offset msg
            int     21h         ; transfer to MS-DOS
            jc      error       ; jump if error
            .
            .
            .
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    If there is no error, the function returns the carry flag cleared and the
    number of characters actually transferred to the list device in register
    AX. Under normal circumstances, this number should always be the same as
    the length requested and the carry flag indicating an error should never
    be set. However, the output will terminate early if your data contains an
    end-of-file mark (Ctrl-Z).

    You can write independently to several list devices (for example, LPT1,
    LPT2) by issuing a specific open request (Int 21H Function 3DH) for each
    device and using the handles returned to access the printers individually
    with Int 21H Function 40H. You have already seen this general approach in
    Chapters 5 and 6.

    An alternative method of printer output is to use the traditional Int 21H
    Function 05H, which transfers the character in the DL register to the
    printer. (This function is sensitive to Ctrl-C interrupts.) For example,
    the assembly-language code sequence at the top of the following page would
    write the the string hello to the line printer.

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    msg     db      'hello'     ; message for printer
    msg_len equ     $-msg       ; length of message
            .
            .
            .
            mov     bx,seg msg  ; DS:BX = string address
            mov     ds,bx
            mov     bx,offset msg
            mov     cx,msg_len  ; CX = string length

    next:   mov     dl,[bx]     ; get next character
            mov     ah,5        ; function 05h = printer output
            int     21h         ; transfer to MS-DOS
            inc     bx          ; bump string pointer
            loop    next        ; loop until string done
            .
            .
            .
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Programs that run on IBM PC─compatible machines can obtain improved
    printer throughput by bypassing MS-DOS and calling the ROM BIOS printer
    driver directly by means of Int 17H. Section III of this book, "IBM ROM
    BIOS and Mouse Functions Reference," documents the Int 17H functions in
    detail. Use of the ROM BIOS functions also allows your program to test
    whether the printer is off line or out of paper, a capability that MS-DOS
    does not offer.

    For example, the following sequence of instructions calls the ROM BIOS
    printer driver to send the string hello to the line printer:

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    msg     db      'hello'     ; message for printer
    msg_len equ     $-msg       ; length of message
            .
            .
            .
            mov     bx,seg msg  ; DS:BX = string address
            mov     ds,bx
            mov     bx,offset msg
            mov     cx,msg_len  ; CX = string length
            mov     dx,0        ; DX = printer number

    next:   mov     al,[bx]     ; AL = character to print
            mov     ah,0        ; function 00h = printer output
            int     17h         ; transfer to ROM BIOS
            inc     bx          ; bump string pointer
            loop    next        ; loop until string done
            .
            .
            .
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Note that the printer numbers used by the ROM BIOS are zero-based, whereas
    the printer numbers in MS-DOS logical-device names are one-based. For
    example, ROM BIOS printer 0 corresponds to LPT1.

    Finally, the most hardware-dependent technique of printer output is to
    access the printer controller directly. Considering the functionality
    already provided in MS-DOS and the IBM ROM BIOS, as well as the speeds of
    the devices involved, I cannot see any justification for using direct
    hardware control in this case. The disadvantage of introducing such
    extreme hardware dependence for such a low-speed device would far outweigh
    any small performance gains that might be obtained.


The Serial Port

    MS-DOS support for serial ports (often referred to as the auxiliary device
    in MS-DOS manuals) is weak compared with its keyboard, video-display, and
    printer support. This is one area where the application programmer is
    justified in making programs hardware dependent to extract adequate
    performance.

    Programs that restrict themselves to MS-DOS functions to ensure
    portability can use the handle read and write functions (Int 21H Functions
    3FH and 40H), with the predefined standard auxiliary handle (3) to
    access the serial port. For example, the following code writes the string
    hello to the serial port that is currently defined as the AUX device:

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    msg     db      'hello'     ; message for serial port
    msg_len equ     $-msg       ; length of message
            .
            .
            .
            mov     ah,40h      ; function 40h = write file or device
            mov     bx,3        ; BX = standard aux handle
            mov     cx,msg_len  ; CX = string length
            mov     dx,seg msg  ; DS:DX = string address
            mov     ds,dx
            mov     dx,offset msg
            int     21h         ; transfer to MS-DOS
            jc      error       ; jump if error
            .
            .
            .
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    The standard auxiliary handle gives access to only the first serial port
    (COM1). If you want to read or write COM2 and COM3 using the handle calls,
    you must issue an open request (Int 21H Function 3DH) for the desired
    serial port and use the handle returned by that function with Int 21H
    Functions 3FH and 40H.

    Some versions of MS-DOS have a bug in character-device handling that
    manifests itself as follows: If you issue a read request with Int 21H
    Function 3FH for the exact number of characters that are waiting in the
    driver's buffer, the length returned in the AX register is the number of
    characters transferred minus one. You can circumvent this problem by
    always requesting more characters than you expect to receive or by placing
    the device handle into binary mode using Int 21H Function 44H.

    MS-DOS also supports two traditional functions for serial-port I/O. Int
    21H Function 03H inputs a character from COM1 and returns it in the AL
    register; Int 21H Function 04H transmits the character in the DL register
    to COM1. Like the other traditional calls, these two are direct
    descendants of the CP/M auxiliary-device functions.

    For example, the following code sends the string hello to COM1 using the
    traditional Int 21H Function 04H:

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    msg     db      'hello'     ; message for serial port
    msg_len equ     $-msg       ; length of message
            .
            .
            .
            mov     bx,seg msg  ; DS:BX = string address
            mov     ds,bx
            mov     bx,offset msg
            mov     cx,msg_len  ; CX = length of string
    mov     dl,[bx]     ; get next character
            mov     ah,4        ; function 04h = aux output
            int     21h         ; transfer to MS-DOS
            inc     bx          ; bump pointer to string
            loop    next        ; loop until string done
            .
            .
            .
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    MS-DOS translates the traditional auxiliary-device functions into calls on
    the same device driver used by the handle calls. Therefore, it is
    generally preferable to use the handle functions in the first place,
    because they allow very long strings to be read or written in one
    operation, they give access to serial ports other than COM1, and they are
    symmetrical with the handle video-display, keyboard, printer, and file I/O
    methods described elsewhere in this book.

    Although the handle or traditional serial-port functions allow you to
    write programs that are portable to any machine running MS-DOS, they have
    a number of disadvantages:

    ■  The built-in MS-DOS serial-port driver is slow and is not interrupt
        driven.

    ■  MS-DOS serial-port I/O is not buffered.

    ■  Determining the status of the auxiliary device requires a separate call
        to the IOCTL function (Int 21H Function 44H)──if you request input and
        no characters are ready, your program will simply hang.

    ■  MS-DOS offers no standardized function to configure the serial port
        from within a program.

    For programs that are going to run on the IBM PC or compatibles, a more
    flexible technique for serial-port I/O is to call the IBM ROM BIOS
    serial-port driver by means of Int 14H. You can use this driver to
    initialize the serial port to a desired configuration and baud rate,
    examine the status of the controller, and read or write characters.
    Section III of this book, "IBM ROM BIOS and Mouse Functions Reference,"
    documents the functions available from the ROM BIOS serial-port driver.

    For example, the following sequence sends the character X to the first
    serial port (COM1):

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
            .
            .
            .
            mov     ah,1        ; function 01h = send character
            mov     al,'X'      ; AL = character to transmit
            mov     dx,0        ; DX = serial-port number
            int     14h         ; transfer to ROM BIOS
            and     ah,80h      ; did transmit fail?
            jnz     error       ; jump if transmit error
            .
            .
            .

    As with the ROM BIOS printer driver, the serial-port numbers used by the
    ROM BIOS are zero-based, whereas the serial-port numbers in MS-DOS
    logical-device names are one-based. In this example, serial port 0
    corresponds to COM1.

    Unfortunately, like the MS-DOS auxiliary-device driver, the ROM BIOS
    serial-port driver is not interrupt driven. Although it will support
    higher transfer speeds than the MS-DOS functions, at rates greater than
    2400 baud it may still lose characters. Consequently, most programmers
    writing high-performance applications that use a serial port (such as
    telecommunications programs) take complete control of the serial-port
    controller and provide their own interrupt driver. The built-in functions
    provided by MS-DOS, and by the ROM BIOS in the case of the IBM PC, are
    simply not adequate.

    Writing such programs requires a good understanding of the hardware. In
    the case of the IBM PC, the chips to study are the INS8250 Asynchronous
    Communications Controller and the Intel 8259A Programmable Interrupt
    Controller. The IBM technical reference documentation for these chips is a
    bit disorganized, but most of the necessary information is there if you
    look for it.


The TALK Program

    The simple terminal-emulator program TALK.ASM (Figure 7-1) is an example
    of a useful program that performs screen, keyboard, and serial-port I/O.
    This program recapitulates all of the topics discussed in Chapters 5
    through 7. TALK uses the IBM PC's ROM BIOS video driver to put characters
    on the screen, to clear the display, and to position the cursor; it uses
    the MS-DOS character-input calls to read the keyboard; and it contains its
    own interrupt driver for the serial-port controller.

    Figure 7-1.  TALK.ASM: A simple terminal-emulator program for IBM
    PC─compatible computers. This program demonstrates use of the MS-DOS and
    ROM BIOS video and keyboard functions and direct control of the
    serial-communications adapter.

    The TALK program illustrates the methods that an application should use to
    take over and service interrupts from the serial port without running
    afoul of MS-DOS conventions.

    The program begins with some equates and conditional assembly statements
    that configure the program for half- or full-duplex and for the desired
    serial port (COM1 or COM2). At entry from MS-DOS, the main routine of the
    program──the procedure named talk──checks the status of the serial port,
    initializes the display, and calls the asc_enb routine to take over the
    serial-port interrupt vector and enable interrupts. The talk procedure
    then enters a loop that reads the keyboard and sends the characters out
    the serial port and then reads the serial port and puts the characters on
    the display──in other words, it causes the PC to emulate a simple CRT
    terminal.

    The TALK program intercepts and handles control codes (carriage return,
    linefeed, and so forth) appropriately. It detects escape sequences and
    handles them as a subset of the Televideo 950 terminal capabilities. (You
    can easily modify the program to emulate any other cursor-addressable
    terminal.) When one of the PC's special function keys is pressed, the
    program disables serial-port interrupts, releases the serial-port
    interrupt vector, and exits back to MS-DOS.

    There are several TALK program procedures that are worth your attention
    because they can easily be incorporated into other programs. These are
    listed in the table on the following page.

Chapter 8  File Management

    The dual heritage of MS-DOS──CP/M and UNIX/XENIX──is perhaps most clearly
    demonstrated in its file-management services. In general, MS-DOS provides
    at least two distinct operating-system calls for each major file or record
    operation. This chapter breaks this overlapping battery of functions into
    two groups and explains the usage, advantages, and disadvantages of each.

    I will refer to the set of file and record functions that are compatible
    with CP/M as FCB functions. These functions rely on a data structure
    called a file control block (hence, FCB) to maintain certain bookkeeping
    information about open files. This structure resides in the application
    program's memory space. The FCB functions allow the programmer to create,
    open, close, and delete files and to read or write records of any size at
    any record position within such files. These functions do not support the
    hierarchical (treelike) file structure that was first introduced in MS-DOS
    version 2.0, so they can be used only to access files in the current
    subdirectory for a given disk drive.

    I will refer to the set of file and record functions that provide
    compatibility with UNIX/XENIX as the handle functions. These functions
    allow the programmer to open or create files by passing MS-DOS a
    null-terminated string that describes the file's location in the
    hierarchical file structure (the drive and path), the file's name, and its
    extension. If the open or create operation is successful, MS-DOS returns a
    16-bit token, or handle, that is saved by the application program and used
    to specify the file in subsequent operations.

    When you use the handle functions, the operating system maintains the data
    structures that contain bookkeeping information about the file inside its
    own memory space, and these structures are not accessible to the
    application program. The handle functions fully support the hierarchical
    file structure, allowing the programmer to create, open, close, and delete
    files in any subdirectory on any disk drive and to read or write records
    of any size at any byte offset within such files.

    Although we are discussing the FCB functions first in this chapter for
    historical reasons, new MS-DOS applications should always be written using
    the more powerful handle functions. Use of the FCB functions in new
    programs should be avoided, unless compatibility with MS-DOS version 1.0
    is needed.


Using the FCB Functions

    Understanding the structure of the file control block is the key to
    success with the FCB family of file and record functions. An FCB is a
    37-byte data structure allocated within the application program's memory
    space; it is divided into many fields (Figure 8-1). Typically, the
    program initializes an FCB with a drive code, a filename, and an extension
    (conveniently accomplished with the parse-filename service, Int 21H
    Function 29H) and then passes the address of the FCB to MS-DOS to open or
    create the file. If the file is successfully opened or created, MS-DOS
    fills in certain fields of the FCB with information from the file's entry
    in the disk directory. This information includes the file's exact size in
    bytes and the date and time the file was created or last updated. MS-DOS
    also places certain other information within a reserved area of the FCB;
    however, this area is used by the operating system for its own purposes
    and varies among different versions of MS-DOS. Application programs should
    never modify the reserved area.

    For compatibility with CP/M, MS-DOS automatically sets the record-size
    field of the FCB to 128 bytes. If the program does not want to use this
    default record size, it must place the desired size (in bytes) into the
    record-size field after the open or create operation. Subsequently, when
    the program needs to read or write records from the file, it must pass the
    address of the FCB to MS-DOS; MS-DOS, in turn, keeps the FCB updated with
    information about the current position of the file pointer and the size of
    the file. Data is always read to or written from the current disk transfer
    area (DTA), whose address is set with Int 21H Function 1AH. If the
    application program wants to perform random record access, it must set the
    record number into the FCB before issuing each function call; when
    sequential record access is being used, MS-DOS maintains the FCB and no
    special intervention is needed from the application.

    In general, MS-DOS functions that use FCBs accept the full address of the
    FCB in the DS:DX register and pass back a return code in the AL register
    (Figure 8-2). For file-management calls (open, close, create, and
    delete), this return code is zero if the function was successful and 0FFH
    (255) if the function failed. For the FCB-type record read and write
    functions, the success code returned in the AL register is again zero, but
    there are several failure codes. Under MS-DOS version 3.0 or later, more
    detailed error reporting can be obtained by calling Int 21H Function 59H
    (Get Extended Error Information) after a failed FCB function call.

    When a program is loaded under MS-DOS, the operating system sets up two
    FCBs in the program segment prefix, at offsets 005CH and 006CH. These are
    often referred to as the default FCBs, and they are included to provide
    upward compatibility from CP/M. MS-DOS parses the first two parameters in
    the command line that invokes the program (excluding any redirection
    directives) into the default FCBs, under the assumption that they may be
    file specifications. The application must determine whether they really
    are filenames or not. In addition, because the default FCBs overlap and
    are not in a particularly convenient location (especially for .EXE
    programs), they usually must be copied elsewhere in order to be used
    safely. (See Chapter 3.)

    to open the file whose name was previously parsed into the FCB named
    my_fcb.

    Note that the structures of FCBs under CP/M and MS-DOS are not identical.
    However, the differences lie chiefly in the reserved areas of the FCBs
    (which should not be manipulated by application programs in any case), so
    well-behaved CP/M applications should be relatively easy to port into
    MS-DOS. It seems, however, that few such applications exist. Many of the
    tricks that were played by clever CP/M programmers to increase performance
    or circumvent the limitations of that operating system can cause severe
    problems under MS-DOS, particularly in networking environments. At any
    rate, much better performance can be achieved by thoroughly rewriting the
    CP/M applications to take advantage of the superior capabilities of
    MS-DOS.

    You can use a special FCB variant called an extended file control block to
    create or access files with special attributes (such as hidden or
    read-only files), volume labels, and subdirectories. An extended FCB has a
    7-byte header followed by the 37-byte structure of a normal FCB (Figure
    8-3). The first byte contains 0FFH, which could never be a legal drive
    code and thus indicates to MS-DOS that an extended FCB is being used. The
    next 5 bytes are reserved and are unused in current versions of MS-DOS.
    The seventh byte contains the attribute of the special file type that is
    being accessed. (Attribute bytes are discussed in more detail in Chapter
    9.) Any MS-DOS function that uses a normal FCB can also use an extended
    FCB.

    The FCB file- and record-management functions may be gathered into the
    following broad classifications:

    Several of these functions have special properties. For example, Int 21H
    Functions 27H (Random Block Read) and 28H (Random Block Write) allow
    reading and writing of multiple records of any size and also update the
    random-record field automatically (unlike Int 21H Functions 21H and
    22H). Int 21H Function 28H can truncate a file to any desired size, and
    Int 21H Function 17H used with an extended FCB can alter a volume label
    or rename a subdirectory.

    Section 2 of this book, "MS-DOS Functions Reference," gives detailed
    specifications for each of the FCB file and record functions, along with
    assembly-language examples. It is also instructive to compare the
    preceding groups with the corresponding groups of handle-type functions
    listed on pages 140─41.

    1.  The drive identification is a binary number: 00=default drive,
        01=drive A:, 02=drive B:, and so on. If the application program
        supplies the drive code as zero (default drive), MS-DOS fills in the
        code for the actual current disk drive after a successful open or
        create call.

    2.  File and extension names must be left justified and padded with
        blanks.

    3.  The file size, date, time, and reserved fields should not be
        modified by applications.

    4.  All word fields are stored with the least significant byte at the
        lower address.

    5.  The relative-record field is treated as 4 bytes if the record size
        is less than 64 bytes; otherwise, only the first 3 bytes of this
        field are used.

    6.  The file-size field is in the same format as in the directory, with
        the less significant word at the lower address.

    7.  The date field is mapped as in the directory. Viewed as a 16-bit
        word (as it would appear in a register), the field is broken down as
        follows:

    9.  The current-block and current-record numbers are used together on
        sequential reads and writes. This simulates the behavior of CP/M.

    10. The Int 21H open (0FH) and create (16H) functions set the
        record-size field to 128 bytes, to provide compatibility with CP/M.
        If you use another record size, you must fill it in after the open
        or create operation.

    11. An 0FFH (255) in the first byte of the structure signifies that it
        is an extended file control block. You can use extended FCBs with
        any of the functions that accept an ordinary FCB. (See also note
        12.)

    12. The attribute byte in an extended FCB allows access to files with
        the special characteristics hidden, system, or read-only. You can
        also use extended FCBs to read volume labels and the contents of
        special subdirectory files.

FCB File-Access Skeleton

    The following is a typical program sequence to access a file using the
    FCB, or traditional, functions (Figure 8-4):

    1.  Zero out the prospective FCB.

    2.  Obtain the filename from the user, from the default FCBs, or from the
        command tail in the PSP.

    3.  If the filename was not obtained from one of the default FCBs, parse
        the filename into the new FCB using Int 21H Function 29H.

    4.  Open the file (Int 21H Function 0FH) or, if writing new data only,
        create the file or truncate any existing file of the same name to zero
        length (Int 21H Function 16H).

    5.  Set the record-size field in the FCB, unless you are using the default
        record size. Recall that it is important to do this after a successful
        open or create operation. (See Figure 8-5.)

    6.  Set the relative-record field in the FCB if you are performing random
        record I/O.

    7.  Set the disk transfer area address using Int 21H Function 1AH, unless
        the buffer address has not been changed since the last call to this
        function. If the application never performs a set DTA, the DTA address
        defaults to offset 0080H in the PSP.

    8.  Request the needed read- or write-record operation (Int 21H Function
        14H─Sequential Read, 15H─Sequential Write, 21H─Random Read,
        22H─Random Write, 27H─Random Block Read, 28H─Random Block Write).

    9.  If the program is not finished processing the file, go to step 6;
        otherwise, close the file (Int 21H Function 10H). If the file was
        used for reading only, you can skip the close operation under early
        versions of MS-DOS. However, this shortcut can cause problems under
        MS-DOS versions 3.0 and later, especially when the files are being
        accessed across a network.

Points to Remember

    Here is a summary of the pros and cons of using the FCB-related file and
    record functions in your programs.

    Advantages:

    ■  Under MS-DOS versions 1 and 2, the number of files that can be open
        concurrently when using FCBs is unlimited. (This is not true under
        MS-DOS versions 3.0 and later, especially if networking software is
        running.)

    ■  File-access methods using FCBs are familiar to programmers with a CP/M
        background, and well-behaved CP/M applications require little change in
        logical flow to run under MS-DOS.

    ■  MS-DOS supplies the size, time, and date for a file to its FCB after
        the file is opened. The calling program can inspect this information.

    Disadvantages:

    ■  FCBs take up room in the application program's memory space.

    ■  FCBs offer no support for the hierarchical file structure (no access to
        files outside the current directory).

    ■  FCBs provide no support for file locking/sharing or record locking in
        networking environments.

    ■  In addition to the read or write call itself, file reads or writes
        using FCBs require manipulation of the FCB to set record size and
        record number, plus a previous call to a separate MS-DOS function to
        set the DTA address.

    ■  Random record I/O using FCBs for a file containing variable-length
        records is very clumsy and inconvenient.

    ■  You must use extended FCBs, which are incompatible with CP/M anyway, to
        access or create files with special attributes such as hidden,
        read-only, or system.

    ■  The FCB file functions have poor error reporting. This situation has
        been improved somewhat in MS-DOS version 3 because a program can call
        the added Int 21H Function 59H (Get Extended Error Information) after
        a failed FCB function to obtain additional information.

    ■  Microsoft discourages use of FCBs. FCBs will make your program more
        difficult to port to MS OS/2 later because MS OS/2 does not support
        FCBs in protected mode at all.


Using the Handle Functions

    The handle file- and record-management functions access files in a fashion
    similar to that used under the UNIX/XENIX operating system. Files are
    designated by an ASCIIZ string (an ASCII character string terminated by a
    null, or zero, byte) that can contain a drive designator, path, filename,
    and extension. For example, the file specification

    C:\SYSTEM\COMMAND.COM

    would appear in memory as the following sequence of bytes:

    43 3A 5C 53 59 53 54 45 4D 5C 43 4F 4D 4D 41 4E 44 2E 43 4F 4D 00

    When a program wishes to open or create a file, it passes the address of
    the ASCIIZ string specifying the file to MS-DOS in the DS:DX registers
    (Figure 8-6). If the operation is successful, MS-DOS returns a 16-bit
    handle to the program in the AX register. The program must save this
    handle for further reference.

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                mov   ah,3dh                  ; function 3dh = open
                mov   al,2                    ; mode 2 = read/write
                mov   dx,seg filename         ; address of ASCIIZ
                mov   ds,dx                   ; file specification
                mov   dx,offset filename
                int   21h                     ; request open from DOS
                jc    error                   ; jump if open failed
                mov   handle,ax               ; save file handle
                .
                .
                .
    filename     db    'C:\MYDIR\MYFILE.DAT',0 ; filename
    handle       dw    0                       ; file handle
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Figure 8-6.  A typical handle file operation. This sequence of code
    attempts to open the file designated in the ASCIIZ string whose address is
    passed to MS-DOS in the DS:DX registers.

    When the program requests subsequent operations on the file, it usually
    places the handle in the BX register before the call to MS-DOS. All the
    handle functions return with the CPU's carry flag cleared if the operation
    was successful, or set if the operation failed; in the latter case, the AX
    register contains a code describing the failure.

    MS-DOS restricts the number of handles that can be active at any one
    time──that is, the number of files and devices that can be open
    concurrently when using the handle family of functions──in two different
    ways:

    ■  The maximum number of concurrently open files in the system, for all
        active processes combined, is specified by the entry

        FILES=nn

        in the CONFIG.SYS file. This entry determines the number of entries
        to be allocated in the system file table; under MS-DOS version 3, the
        default value is 8 and the maximum is 255. After MS-DOS is booted and
        running, you cannot expand this table to increase the total number of
        files that can be open. You must use an editor to modify the CONFIG.SYS
        file and then restart the system.

    ■  The maximum number of concurrently open files for a single process is
        20, assuming that sufficient entries are also available in the system
        file table. When a program is loaded, MS-DOS preassigns 5 of its
        potential 20 handles to the standard devices. Each time the process
        issues an open or create call, MS-DOS assigns a handle from the
        process's private allocation of 20, until all the handles are used up
        or the system file table is full. In MS-DOS versions 3.3 and later, you
        can expand the per-process limit of 20 handles with a call to Int 21H
        Function 67H (Set Handle Count).

    The handle file- and record-management calls may be gathered into the
    following broad classifications for study:

╓┌─┌────────────────────────┌────────────────────────────────────────────────╖

    3EH                     Close file.

    Compare the groups of handle-type functions in the preceding table with
    the groups of FCB functions outlined earlier, noting the degree of
    functional overlap. Section 2 of this book, "MS-DOS Functions Reference,"
    gives detailed specifications for each of the handle functions, along with
    assembly-language examples.

Handle File-Access Skeleton

    The following is a typical program sequence to access a file using the
    handle family of functions (Figure 8-7):

    1.  Get the filename from the user by means of the buffered input service
        (Int 21H Function 0AH) or from the command tail supplied by MS-DOS in
        the PSP.

    2.  Put a zero at the end of the file specification in order to create an
        ASCIIZ string.

    3.  Open the file using Int 21H Function 3DH and mode 2 (read/write
        access), or create the file using Int 21H Function 3CH. (Be sure to
        set the CX register to zero, so that you don't accidentally make a
        file with special attributes.) Save the handle that is returned.

    4.  Set the file pointer using Int 21H Function 42H. You may set the
        file-pointer position relative to one of three different locations:
        the start of the file, the current pointer position, or the end of the
        file. If you are performing sequential record I/O, you can usually
        skip this step because MS-DOS will maintain the file pointer for you
        automatically.

    5.  Read from the file (Int 21H Function 3FH) or write to the file (Int
        21H Function 40H). Both of these functions require that the BX
        register contain the file's handle, the CX register contain the length
        of the record, and the DS:DX registers point to the data being
        transferred. Both return the actual number of bytes transferred in the
        AX register.

        In a read operation, if the number of bytes read is less than the
        number requested, the end of the file has been reached. In a write
        operation, if the number of bytes written is less than the number
        requested, the disk containing the file is full. Neither of these
        conditions is returned as an error code; that is, the carry flag is
        not set.

    6.  If the program is not finished processing the file, go to step 4;
        otherwise, close the file (Int 21H Function 3EH). Any normal exit
        from the program will also close all active handles.

    Figure 8-7.  Skeleton of an assembly-language program that performs
    sequential processing on an input file and writes the results to an output
    file using the handle file and record functions. This code assumes that
    the DS and ES registers have already been set to point to the segment
    containing the buffers and filenames.

Points to Remember

    Here is a summary of the pros and cons of using the handle file and record
    operations in your program. Compare this list with the one given earlier
    in the chapter for the FCB family of functions.

    Advantages:

    ■  The handle calls provide direct support for I/O redirection and pipes
        with the standard input and output devices in a manner functionally
        similar to that used by UNIX/XENIX.

    ■  The handle functions provide direct support for directories (the
        hierarchical file structure) and special file attributes.

    ■  The handle calls support file sharing/locking and record locking in
        networking environments.

    ■  Using the handle functions, the programmer can open channels to
        character devices and treat them as files.

    ■  The handle calls make the use of random record access extremely easy.
        The current file pointer can be moved to any byte offset relative to
        the start of the file, the end of the file, or the current pointer
        position. Records of any length, up to an entire segment (65,535
        bytes), can be read to any memory address in one operation.

    ■  The handle functions have relatively good error reporting in MS-DOS
        version 2, and error reporting has been enhanced even further in MS-DOS
        versions 3.0 and later.

    ■  Microsoft strongly encourages use of the handle family of functions in
        order to provide upward compatibility with MS OS/2.

    Disadvantages:

    ■  There is a limit per program of 20 concurrently open files and devices
        using handles in MS-DOS versions 2.0 through 3.2.

    ■  Minor gaps still exist in the implementation of the handle functions.
        For example, you must still use extended FCBs to change volume labels
        and to access the contents of the special files that implement
        directories.


MS-DOS Error Codes

    When one of the handle file functions fails with the carry flag set, or
    when a program calls Int 21H Function 59H (Get Extended Error
    Information) following a failed FCB function or other system service, one
    of the following error codes may be returned:

    Under MS-DOS versions 3.0 and later, you can also use Int 21H Function
    59H to obtain other information about the error, such as the error locus
    and the recommended recovery action.

Critical-Error Handlers

    In Chapter 5, we discussed how an application program can take over the
    Ctrl-C handler vector (Int 23H) and replace the MS-DOS default handler, to
    avoid losing control of the computer when the user enters a Ctrl-C or
    Ctrl-Break at the keyboard. Similarly, MS-DOS provides a
    critical-error-handler vector (Int 24H) that defines the routine to be
    called when unrecoverable hardware faults occur. The default MS-DOS
    critical-error handler is the routine that displays a message describing
    the error type and the cue

    Abort, Retry, Ignore?

    This message appears after such actions as the following:

    ■  Attempting to open a file on a disk drive that doesn't contain a floppy
        disk or whose door isn't closed

    ■  Trying to read a disk sector that contains a CRC error

    ■  Trying to print when the printer is off line

    The unpleasant thing about MS-DOS's default critical-error handler is, of
    course, that if the user enters an A for Abort, the application that is
    currently executing is terminated abruptly and never has a chance to clean
    up and make a graceful exit. Intermediate files may be left on the disk,
    files that have been extended using FCBs are not properly closed so that
    the directory is updated, interrupt vectors may be left pointing into the
    transient program area, and so forth.

    To write a truly bombproof MS-DOS application, you must take over the
    critical-error-handler vector and point it to your own routine, so that
    your program intercepts all catastrophic hardware errors and handles them
    appropriately. You can use MS-DOS Int 21H Function 25H to alter the Int
    24H vector in a well-behaved manner. When your application exits, MS-DOS
    will automatically restore the previous contents of the Int 24H vector
    from information saved in the program segment prefix.

    MS-DOS calls the critical-error handler for two general classes of
    errors── disk-related and non-disk-related──and passes different
    information to the handler in the registers for each of these classes.

    For disk-related errors, MS-DOS sets the registers as shown on the
    following page. (Bits 3─5 of the AH register are relevant only in MS-DOS
    versions 3.1 and later.)

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


    For non-disk-related errors, the interrupt was generated either as the
    result of a character-device error or because a corrupted memory image of
    the file allocation table was detected. In this case, MS-DOS sets the
    registers as follows:

    Register           Bit(s)            Significance
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    AH                 7                 1, to signify a non-disk error
    DI                 0─7               Driver error code

                                        header
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    To determine whether the critical error was caused by a character device,
    use the address in the BP:SI registers to examine the device attribute
    word at offset 0004H in the presumed device-driver header. If bit 15 is
    set, then the error was indeed caused by a character device, and the
    program can inspect the name field of the driver's header to determine the
    device.

    At entry to a critical-error handler, MS-DOS has already disabled
    interrupts and set up the stack as shown in Figure 8-8. A critical-error
    handler cannot use any MS-DOS services except Int 21H Functions 01H
    through 0CH (Traditional Character I/O), Int 21H Function 30H (Get MS-DOS
    Version), and Int 21H Function 59H (Get Extended Error Information).
    These functions use a special stack so that the context of the original
    function (which generated the critical error) will not be lost.

    Figure 8-8.  The stack at entry to a critical-error handler.

    The critical-error handler should return to MS-DOS by executing an IRET,
    passing one of the following action codes in the AL register:

    Code               Meaning
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    0                  Ignore the error (MS-DOS acts as though the original
                        function call had succeeded).
    1                  Retry the operation.
    2                  Terminate the process that encountered the error.
    3                  Fail the function (an error code is returned to the
                        requesting process). Versions 3.1 and later only.
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    The critical-error handler should preserve all other registers and must
    not modify the device-driver header pointed to by BP:SI. A skeleton
    example of a critical-error handler is shown in Figure 8-9.

Example Programs: DUMP.ASM and DUMP.C

    The programs DUMP.ASM (Figure 8-10) and DUMP.C (Figure 8-11) are
    parallel examples of the use of the handle file and record functions. The
    assembly-language version, in particular, illustrates features of a
    well-behaved MS-DOS utility:

    ■  The program checks the version of MS-DOS to ensure that all the
        functions it is going to use are really available.

    ■  The program parses the drive, path, and filename from the command tail
        in the program segment prefix.

    ■  The program uses buffered I/O for speed.

    ■  The program sends error messages to the standard error device.

    ■  The program sends normal program output to the standard output device,
        so that the dump output appears by default on the system console but
        can be redirected to other character devices (such as the line printer)
        or to a file.

    The same features are incorporated into the C version of the program, but
    some of them are taken care of behind the scenes by the C runtime library.

    Figure 8-11.  The C version: DUMP.C.

    The assembly-language version of the DUMP program contains a number of
    subroutines that you may find useful in your own programming efforts.
    These include the following:

    Subroutine  Action
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    argc        Returns the number of command-line arguments.
    argv        Returns the address and length of a particular command-line
                argument.
    w2a         Converts a binary word (16 bits) into hex ASCII for output.
    b2a         Converts a binary byte (8 bits) into hex ASCII for output.
    ascii       Converts 4 bits into a single hex ASCII character.
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    It is interesting to compare these two equivalent programs. The C program
    contains only 77 lines, whereas the assembly-language program has 436
    lines. Clearly, the C source code is less complex and easier to maintain.
    On the other hand, if size and efficiency are important, the DUMP.EXE file
    generated by the C compiler is 8563 bytes, whereas the assembly-language
    DUMP.EXE file is only 1294 bytes and runs twice as fast as the C program.

Chapter 9  Volumes and Directories

    Each file in an MS-DOS system is uniquely identified by its name and its
    location. The location, in turn, has two components: the logical drive
    that contains the file and the directory on that drive where the filename
    can be found.

    Logical drives are specified by a single letter followed by a colon (for
    example, A:). The number of logical drives in a system is not necessarily
    the same as the number of physical drives; for example, it is common for
    large fixed-disk drives to be divided into two or more logical drives. The
    key aspect of a logical drive is that it contains a self-sufficient file
    system; that is, it contains one or more directories, zero or more
    complete files, and all the information needed to locate the files and
    directories and to determine which disk space is free and which is already
    in use.

    Directories are simply lists or catalogs. Each entry in a directory
    consists of the name, size, starting location, attributes, and last
    modification date and time of a file or another directory that the disk
    contains. The detailed information about the location of every block of
    data assigned to a file or directory is in a separate control area on the
    disk called the file allocation table (FAT). (See Chapter 10 for a
    detailed discussion of the internal format of directories and the FAT.)

    Every disk potentially has two distinct kinds of directories: the root
    directory and all other directories. The root directory is always present
    and has a maximum number of entries, determined when the disk is
    formatted; this number cannot be changed. The subdirectories of the root
    directory, which may or may not be present on a given disk, can be nested
    to any level and can grow to any size (Figure 9-1). This is the
    hierarchical, or tree, directory structure referred to in earlier
    chapters. Every directory has a name, except for the root directory, which
    is designated by a single backslash (\) character.

    MS-DOS keeps track of a "current drive" for the system and uses this drive
    when a file specification does not include an explicit drive code.
    Similarly, MS-DOS maintains a "current directory" for each logical drive.
    You can select any particular directory on a drive by naming in order──
    either from the root directory or relative to the current directory──the
    directories that lead to its location in the tree structure. Such a list
    of directories, separated by backslash delimiters, is called a path. When
    a complete path from the root directory is prefixed by a logical drive
    code and followed by a filename and extension, the resulting string is a
    fully qualified filename and unambiguously specifies a file.

Drive and Directory Control

    You can examine, select, create, and delete disk directories interactively
    with the DIR, CHDIR (CD), MKDIR (MD), and RMDIR (RD) commands. You can
    select a new current drive by entering the letter of the desired drive,
    followed by a colon. MS-DOS provides the following Int 21H functions to
    give application programs similar control over drives and directories:

    Function                 Action
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    0EH                     Select current drive.
    19H                     Get current drive.
    39H                     Create directory.
    3AH                     Remove directory.
    3BH                     Select current directory.
    47H                     Get current directory.
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    The two functions that deal with disk drives accept or return a binary
    drive code──0 represents drive A, 1 represents drive B, and so on. This
    differs from most other MS-DOS functions, which use 0 to indicate the
    current drive, 1 for drive A, and so on.

    The first three directory functions in the preceding list require an
    ASCIIZ string that describes the path to the desired directory. As with
    the handle-based file open and create functions, the address of the ASCIIZ
    string is passed in the DS:DX registers. On return, the carry flag is
    clear if the function succeeds or set if the function failed, with an
    error code in the AX register. The directory functions can fail for a
    variety of reasons, but the most common cause of an error is that some
    element of the indicated path does not exist.

    The last function in the preceding list, Int 21H Function 47H, allows you
    to obtain an ASCIIZ path for the current directory on the specified or
    default drive. MS-DOS supplies the path string without the drive
    identifier or a leading backslash. Int 21H Function 47H is most commonly
    used with Int 21H Function 19H to build fully qualified filenames. Such
    filenames are desirable because they remain valid if the user changes the
    current drive or directory.

    Section 2 of this book, "MS-DOS Functions Reference," gives detailed
    information on the drive and directory control functions.

Searching Directories

    When you request an open operation on a file, you are implicitly
    performing a search of a directory. MS-DOS examines each entry of the
    directory to find a match for the filename you have given as an argument;
    if the file is found, MS-DOS copies certain information from the directory
    into a data structure that it can use to control subsequent read or write
    operations to the file. Thus, if you wish to test for the existence of a
    specific file, you need only perform an open operation and observe whether
    it is successful. (If it is, you should, of course, perform a subsequent
    close operation to avoid needless expenditure of handles.)

    Sometimes you may need to perform more elaborate searches of a disk
    directory. Perhaps you wish to find all the files with a certain
    extension, a file with a particular attribute, or the names of the
    subdirectories of a certain directory. Although the locations of a disk's
    directories and the specifics of the entries that are found in them are of
    necessity hardware dependent (for example, interpretation of the field
    describing the starting location of a file depends upon the physical disk
    format), MS-DOS does provide functions that will allow examination of a
    disk directory in a hardware-independent fashion.

    In order to search a disk directory successfully, you must understand two
    types of MS-DOS search services. The first type is the "search for first"
    function, which accepts a file specification──possibly including wildcard
    characters──and looks for the first matching file in the directory of
    interest. If it finds a match, the function fills a buffer owned by the
    requesting program with information about the file; if it does not find a
    match, it returns an error flag.

    A program can call the second type of search service, called "search for
    next," only after a successful "search for first." If the file
    specification that was originally passed to "search for first" included
    wildcard characters and at least one matching file was present, the
    program can call "search for next" as many times as necessary to find all
    additional matching files. Like "search for first," "search for next"
    returns information about the matched files in a buffer designated by the
    requesting program. When it can find no more matching files, "search for
    next" returns an error flag.

    As with nearly every other operation, MS-DOS provides two parallel sets of
    directory-searching services:

    Action             FCB function      Handle function
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Search for first   11H               4EH
    Search for next    12H               4FH
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    The FCB directory functions allow searches to match a filename and
    extension, both possibly containing wildcard characters, within the
    current directory for the specified or current drive. The handle directory
    functions, on the other hand, allow a program to perform searches within
    any directory on any drive, regardless of the current directory.

    Searches that use normal FCBs find only normal files. Searches that use
    extended FCBs, or the handle-type functions, can be qualified with file
    attributes. The attribute bits relevant to searches are as follows:

    Bit                      Significance
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    0                        Read-only file
    1                        Hidden file
    2                        System file
    3                        Volume label
    4                        Directory
    5                        Archive needed (set when file modified)
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    The remaining bits of a search function's attribute parameter should be
    zero. When any of the preceding attribute bits are set, the search
    function returns all normal files plus any files with the specified
    attributes, except in the case of the volume-label attribute bit, which
    receives special treatment as described later in this chapter. Note that
    by setting bit 4 you can include directories in a search, exactly as
    though they were files.

    Both the FCB and handle directory-searching functions require that the
    disk transfer area address be set (with Int 21H Function 1AH), before the
    call to "search for first," to point to a working buffer for use by
    MS-DOS. The DTA address should not be changed between calls to "search for
    first" and "search for next." When it finds a matching file, MS-DOS places
    the information about the file in the buffer and then inspects the buffer
    on the next "search for next" call, to determine where to resume the
    search. The format of the data returned in the buffer is different for the
    FCB and handle functions, so read the detailed descriptions in Section 2
    of this book, "MS-DOS Functions Reference," before attempting to interpret
    the buffer contents.

    Figures 9-2 and 9-3 provide equivalent examples of searches for all
    files in a given directory that have the .ASM extension, one example using
    the FCB directory functions (Int 21H Functions 11H and 12H) and the
    other using the handle functions (Int 21H Functions 4EH and 4FH). (Both
    programs use the handle write function with the standard output handle to
    display the matched filenames, to avoid introducing tangential differences
    in the listings.)

Moving Files

    The rename file function that was added in MS-DOS version 2.0, Int 21H
    Function 56H, has the little-advertised capability to move a file from
    one directory to another. The function has two ASCIIZ parameters: the
    "old" and "new" names for the file. If the old and new paths differ,
    MS-DOS moves the file; if the filename or extension components differ,
    MS-DOS renames the file. MS-DOS can carry out both of these actions in the
    same function call.

    Of course, the old and new directories must be on the same drive, because
    the file's actual data is not moved at all; only the information that
    describes the file is removed from one directory and placed in another
    directory. Function 56H fails if the two ASCIIZ strings include different
    logical-drive codes, if the file is read-only, or if a file with the same
    name and location as the "new" filename already exists.

    The FCB-based rename file service, Int 21H Function 17H, works only on
    the current directory and cannot be used to move files.


Volume Labels

    Support for volume labels was first added to MS-DOS in version 2.0. A
    volume label is an optional name of from 1 to 11 characters that the user
    assigns to a disk during a FORMAT operation. You can display a volume
    label with the DIR, TREE, CHKDSK, or VOL command. Beginning with MS-DOS
    version 3.0, you can use the LABEL command to add, display, or alter the
    label after formatting. In MS-DOS version 4, the FORMAT program also
    assigns a semi-random 32-bit binary ID to each disk it formats; you can
    display this value, but you cannot change it.

    The distinction between volumes and drives is important. A volume label is
    associated with a specific storage medium. A drive identifier (such as A)
    is associated with a physical device that a storage medium can be mounted
    on. In the case of fixed-disk drives, the medium associated with a drive
    identifier does not change (hence the name). In the case of floppy disks
    or other removable media, the disk accessed with a given drive identifier
    might have any volume label or none at all.

    Hence, volume labels do not take the place of the logical-drive identifier
    and cannot be used as part of a pathname to identify a file. In fact, in
    MS-DOS version 2, the system does not use volume labels internally at all.
    In MS-DOS versions 3.0 and later, a disk driver can use volume labels to
    detect whether the user has replaced a disk while a file is open; this use
    is optional, however, and is not implemented in all systems.

    MS-DOS volume labels are implemented as a special type of entry in a
    disk's root directory. The entry contains a time-and-date stamp and has an
    attribute value of 8 (i.e., bit 3 set). Except for the attribute, a volume
    label is identical to the directory entry for a file that was created but
    never had any data written into it, and you can manipulate volume labels
    with Int 21H functions much as you manipulate files. However, a volume
    label receives special handling at several levels:

    ■  When you create a volume label after a disk is formatted, MS-DOS always
        places it in the root directory, regardless of the current directory.

    ■  A disk can contain only one volume label; attempts to create additional
        volume labels (even with different names) will fail.

    ■  MS-DOS always carries out searches for volume labels in the root
        directory, regardless of the current directory, and does not also
        return all normal files.

    In MS-DOS version 2, support for volume labels is not completely
    integrated into the handle file functions, and you must use extended FCBs
    instead to manipulate volume labels. For example, the code in Figure 9-4
    searches for the volume label in the root directory of the current drive.
    You can also change volume labels with extended FCBs and the rename file
    function (Int 21H Function 17H), but you should not attempt to remove an
    existing volume label with Int 21H Function 13H under MS-DOS version 2,
    because this operation can damage the disk's FAT in an unpredictable
    manner.

    In MS-DOS versions 3.0 and later, you can create a volume label in the
    expected manner, using Int 21H Function 3CH and an attribute of 8, and
    you can use the handle-type "search for first" function (4EH) to obtain
    an existing volume label for a logical drive (Figure 9-5). However, you
    still must use extended FCBs to change a volume label.

Chapter 10  Disk Internals

    MS-DOS disks are organized according to a rather rigid scheme that is
    easily understood and therefore easily manipulated. Although you will
    probably never need to access the special control areas of a disk
    directly, an understanding of their internal structure leads to a better
    understanding of the behavior and performance of MS-DOS as a whole.

    From the application programmer's viewpoint, MS-DOS presents disk devices
    as logical volumes that are associated with a drive code (A, B, C, and so
    on) and that have a volume name (optional), a root directory, and from
    zero to many additional directories and files. MS-DOS shields the
    programmer from the physical characteristics of the medium by providing a
    battery of disk services through Int 21H. Using these services, the
    programmer can create, open, read, write, close, and delete files in a
    uniform way, regardless of the disk drive's size, speed, number of
    read/write heads, number of tracks, and so forth.

    Requests from an application program for file operations actually go
    through two levels of translation before resulting in the physical
    transfer of data between the disk device and random-access memory:

    1.  Beneath the surface, MS-DOS views each logical volume, whether it is
        an entire physical unit such as a floppy disk or only a part of a
        fixed disk, as a continuous sequence of logical sectors, starting at
        sector 0. (A logical disk volume can also be implemented on other
        types of storage. For example, RAM disks map a disk structure onto an
        area of random-access memory.) MS-DOS translates an application
        program's Int 21H file-management requests into requests for transfers
        of logical sectors, using the information found in the volume's
        directories and allocation tables. (For those rare situations where it
        is appropriate, programs can also access logical sectors directly with
        Int 25H and Int 26H.)

    2.  MS-DOS then passes the requests for logical sectors to the disk
        device's driver, which maps them onto actual physical addresses (head,
        track, and sector). Disk drivers are extremely hardware dependent and
        are always written in assembly language for maximum speed. In most
        versions of MS-DOS, a driver for IBM-compatible floppy- and fixed-disk
        drives is built into the MS-DOS BIOS module (IO.SYS) and is always
        loaded during system initialization; you can install additional
        drivers for non-IBM-compatible disk devices by including the
        appropriate DEVICE directives in the CONFIG.SYS file.

    Each MS-DOS logical volume is divided into several fixed-size control
    areas and a files area (Figure 10-1). The size of each control area
    depends on several factors──the size of the volume and the version of
    FORMAT used to initialize the volume, for example──but all of the
    information needed to interpret the structure of a particular logical
    volume can be found on the volume itself in the boot sector.

    Figure 10-1.  Map of a typical MS-DOS logical volume. The boot sector
    (logical sector 0) contains the OEM identification, BIOS parameter block
    (BPB), and disk bootstrap. The remaining sectors are divided among an
    optional reserved area, one or more copies of the file allocation table,
    the root directory, and the files area.


The Boot Sector

    Logical sector 0, known as the boot sector, contains all of the critical
    information regarding the disk medium's characteristics (Figure 10-2).
    The first byte in the sector is always an 80x86 jump instruction──either a
    normal intrasegment JMP (opcode 0E9H) followed by a 16-bit displacement or
    a "short" JMP (opcode 0EBH) followed by an 8-bit displacement and then by
    an NOP (opcode 90H). If neither of these two JMP opcodes is present, the
    disk has not been formatted or was not formatted for use with MS-DOS. (Of
    course, the presence of the JMP opcode does not in itself ensure that the
    disk has an MS-DOS format.)

    Following the initial JMP instruction is an 8-byte field that is reserved
    by Microsoft for OEM identification. The disk-formatting program, which is
    specialized for each brand of computer, disk controller, and medium, fills
    in this area with the name of the computer manufacturer and the
    manufacturer's internal MS-DOS version number.

    Figure 10-2.  Map of the boot sector of an MS-DOS disk. Note the JMP at
    offset 0, the OEM identification field, the MS-DOS version 2 compatible
    BIOS parameter block (bytes 0BH─17H), the three additional WORD fields for
    MS-DOS version 3, the double-word number-of-sectors field and 32-bit
    binary volume ID for MS-DOS version 4.0, and the bootstrap code.

    The third major component of the boot sector is the BIOS parameter block
    (BPB) in bytes 0BH through 17H. (Additional fields are present in MS-DOS
    versions 3.0 and later.) This data structure describes the physical disk
    characteristics and allows the device driver to calculate the proper
    physical disk address for a given logical-sector number; it also contains
    information that is used by MS-DOS and various system utilities to
    calculate the address and size of each of the disk control areas (file
    allocation tables and root directory).

    The final element of the boot sector is the disk bootstrap routine. The
    disk bootstrap is usually read into memory by the ROM bootstrap, which is
    executed automatically when the computer is turned on. The ROM bootstrap
    is usually just smart enough to home the head of the disk drive (move it
    to track 0), read the first physical sector into RAM at a predetermined
    location, and jump to it. The disk bootstrap is more sophisticated. It
    calculates the physical disk address of the beginning of the files area,
    reads the files containing the operating system into memory, and transfers
    control to the BIOS module at location 0070:0000H. (See Chapter 2.)

    Figures 10-3 and 10-4 show a partial hex dump and disassembly of a
    PC-DOS 3.3 floppy-disk boot sector.

    10-3.


The Reserved Area

    The boot sector is actually part of a reserved area that can span from one
    to several sectors. The reserved-sectors word in the BPB, at offset 0EH in
    the boot sector, describes the size of this area. Remember that the number
    in the BPB field includes the boot sector itself, so if the value is 1 (as
    it is on IBM PC floppy disks), the length of the reserved area is actually
    0 sectors.


The File Allocation Table

    When a file is created or extended, MS-DOS assigns it groups of disk
    sectors from the files area in powers of 2. These are known as allocation
    units or clusters. The number of sectors per cluster for a given medium is
    defined in the BPB and can be found at offset 0DH in the disk's boot
    sector. Below are some example cluster sizes:

    Disk type                     Power of 2    Sectors/cluster
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    5.25" 180 KB floppy disk      0             1
    5.25" 360 KB floppy disk      1             2
    PC/AT fixed disk              2             4
    PC/XT fixed disk              3             8
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    The file allocation table (FAT) is divided into fields that correspond
    directly to the assignable clusters on the disk. These fields are 12 bits
    in MS-DOS versions 1 and 2 and may be either 12 bits or 16 bits in
    versions 3.0 and later, depending on the size of the medium (12 bits if
    the disk contains fewer than 4087 clusters, 16 bits otherwise).

    The first two fields in the FAT are always reserved. On IBM-compatible
    media, the first 8 bits of the first reserved FAT entry contain a copy of
    the media descriptor byte, which is also found in the BPB in the boot
    sector. The second, third, and (if applicable) fourth bytes, which
    constitute the remainder of the first two reserved FAT fields, always
    contain 0FFH. The currently defined IBM-format media descriptor bytes are
    as follows:

                                                                MS-DOS version
                                                                where first
    Descriptor     Medium                                      supported
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    0F9H           5.25" floppy disk, 2-sided, 15-sector       3.0
                    3.5" floppy disk, 2-sided, 9-sector         3.2
    0FCH           5.25" floppy disk, 1-sided, 9-sector        2.0
    0FDH           5.25" floppy disk, 2-sided, 9-sector        2.0
                    8" floppy disk, 1-sided, single-density
    0FEH           5.25" floppy disk, 1-sided, 8-sector        1.0

    The remainder of the FAT entries describe the use of their corresponding
    disk clusters. The contents of the FAT fields are interpreted as follows:

    (X)XXX             Next cluster in file
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Each file's entry in a directory contains the number of the first cluster
    assigned to that file, which is used as an entry point into the FAT. From
    the entry point on, each FAT slot contains the cluster number of the next
    cluster in the file, until a last-cluster mark is encountered.

    At the computer manufacturer's option, MS-DOS can maintain two or more
    identical copies of the FAT on each volume. MS-DOS updates all copies
    simultaneously whenever files are extended or the directory is modified.
    If access to a sector in a FAT fails due to a read error, MS-DOS tries the
    other copies until a successful disk read is obtained or all copies are
    exhausted. Thus, if one copy of the FAT becomes unreadable due to wear or
    a software accident, the other copies may still make it possible to
    salvage the files on the disk. As part of its procedure for checking the
    integrity of a disk, the CHKDSK program compares the multiple copies
    (usually two) of the FAT to make sure they are all readable and
    consistent.


The Root Directory

    Following the file allocation tables is an area known in MS-DOS versions
    2.0 and later as the root directory. (Under MS-DOS version 1, it was the
    only directory on the disk.) The root directory contains 32-byte entries
    that describe files, other directories, and the optional volume label
    (Figure 10-5). An entry beginning with the byte value E5H is available
    for reuse; it represents a file or directory that has been erased. An
    entry beginning with a null (zero) byte is the logical end-of-directory;
    that entry and all subsequent entries have never been used.

    Notes for Figure 10-5
    1.  The first byte of the filename field of a directory entry may
        contain the following special information:

    Value             Meaning
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    00H               Directory entry has never been used; end of occupied
                        portion of directory.
    05H               First character of filename is actually E5H.
    2EH               Entry is an alias for the current or parent directory.
                        If the next byte is also 2EH, the cluster field
                        contains the cluster number of the parent directory
                        (zero if the parent directory is the root directory).
    E5H               File has been erased.
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    2.  The attribute byte of the directory entry is mapped as follows:

    Bit               Meaning
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    0                 Read-only; attempts to open file for write or to
                        delete file will fail.
    1                 Hidden file; excluded from normal searches.
    2                 System file; excluded from normal searches.
    3                 Volume label; can exist only in root directory.
    4                 Directory; excluded from normal searches.
    5                 Archive bit; set whenever file is modified.
    6                 Reserved.
    7                 Reserved.
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    3.  The time field is encoded as follows:

    Bits              Contents
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    00H─04H           Binary number of 2-second increments (0─29,
                        corresponding to 0─58 seconds)
    05H─0AH           Binary number of minutes (0─59)
    0BH─0FH           Binary number of hours (0─23)
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    4.  The date field is encoded as follows:

    Bits              Contents
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    00H─04H           Day of month (1─31)
    05H─08H           Month (1─12)
    09H─0FH           Year (relative to 1980)
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    5.  The file-size field is interpreted as a 4-byte integer, with the
        low-order 2 bytes of the number stored first.

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    The root directory has a number of special properties. Its size and
    position are fixed and are determined by the FORMAT program when a disk is
    initialized. This information can be obtained from the boot sector's BPB.
    If the disk is bootable, the first two entries in the root directory
    always describe the files containing the MS-DOS BIOS and the MS-DOS
    kernel. The disk bootstrap routine uses these entries to bring the
    operating system into memory and start it up.

    Figure 10-6 shows a partial hex dump of the first sector of the root
    directory on a bootable PC-DOS 3.3 floppy disk.

    for a PC-DOS 3.3 disk containing the three system files and a volume
    label.


The Files Area

    The remainder of the volume after the root directory is known as the files
    area. MS-DOS views the sectors in this area as a pool of clusters, each
    containing one or more logical sectors, depending on the disk format. Each
    cluster has a corresponding entry in the FAT that describes its current
    use: available, reserved, assigned to a file, or unusable (because of
    defects in the medium). Because the first two fields of the FAT are
    reserved, the first cluster in the files area is assigned the number 2.

    When a file is extended under versions 1 and 2, MS-DOS searches the FAT
    from the beginning until it finds a free cluster (designated by a zero FAT
    field); it then changes that FAT field to a last-cluster mark and updates
    the previous last cluster of the file's chain to point to the new last
    cluster. Under versions 3.0 and later, however, MS-DOS searches the FAT
    from the most recently allocated cluster; this reduces file fragmentation
    and improves overall access times.

    Directories other than the root directory are simply a special type of
    file. Their storage is allocated from the files area, and their contents
    are 32-byte entries──in the same format as those used in the root
    directory──that describe files or other directories. Directory entries
    that describe other directories contain an attribute byte with bit 4 set,
    zero in the file-length field, and the date and time that the directory
    was created (Figure 10-7). The first cluster field points, of course, to
    the first cluster in the files area that belongs to the directory. (The
    directory's other clusters can be found only by tracing through the FAT.)

    All directories except the root directory contain two special directory
    entries with the names . and ... MS-DOS puts these entries in place when
    it creates a directory, and they cannot be deleted. The . entry is an
    alias for the current directory; its cluster field points to the cluster
    in which it is found. The .. entry is an alias for the directory's parent
    (the directory immediately above it in the tree structure); its cluster
    field points to the first cluster of the parent directory. If the parent
    is the root directory, the cluster field of the .. entry contains zero
    (Figure 10-8).

Interpreting the File Allocation Table

    Now that we understand how the disk is structured, let's see how we can
    use this knowledge to find a FAT position from a cluster number.

    If the FAT has 12-bit entries, use the following procedure:

    1.  Use the directory entry to find the starting cluster of the file in
        question.

    2.  Multiply the cluster number by 1.5.

    3.  Use the integral part of the product as the offset into the FAT and
        move the word at that offset into a register. Remember that a FAT
        position can span a physical disk-sector boundary.

    4.  If the product is a whole number, AND the register with 0FFFH.

    5.  Otherwise, "logical shift" the register right 4 bits.

    6.  If the result is a value from 0FF8H through 0FFFH, the file has no
        more clusters. Otherwise, the result is the number of the next cluster
        in the file.

    On disks with at least 4087 clusters formatted under MS-DOS version 3.0 or
    later, the FAT entries use 16 bits, and the extraction of a cluster number
    from the table is much simpler:

    1.  Use the directory entry to find the starting cluster of the file in
        question.

    2.  Multiply the cluster number by 2.

    3.  Use the product as the offset into the FAT and move the word at that
        offset into a register.

    4.  If the result is a value from 0FFF8H through 0FFFFH, the file has no
        more clusters. Otherwise, the result is the number of the next cluster
        in the file.

    To convert cluster numbers to logical sectors, subtract 2, multiply the
    result by the number of sectors per cluster, and add the logical-sector
    number of the beginning of the data area (this can be calculated from the
    information in the BPB).

    As an example, let's work out the disk location of the file IBMBIO.COM,
    which is the first entry in the directory shown in Figure 10-6. First, we
    need some information from the BPB, which is in the boot sector of the
    medium. (See Figures 10-3 and 10-4.) The BPB tells us that there are

    ■  512 bytes per sector

    ■  2 sectors per cluster

    ■  2 sectors per FAT

    ■  2 FATs

    ■  112 entries in the root directory

    From the BPB information, we can calculate the starting logical-sector
    number of each of the disk's control areas and the files area by
    constructing a table, as follows:

                                                    Length       Sector
    Area                                             (sectors)    numbers
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Boot sector                                      1            00H
    2 FATs * 2 sectors/FAT                           4            01H─04H
    112 directory entries                            7            05H─0BH
    *32 bytes/entry
    /512 bytes/sector
    Total sectors occupied by bootstrap, FATs, and   12
    root directory
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Therefore, the first sector of the files area is 12 (0CH).

    The word at offset 01AH in the directory entry for IBMBIO.COM gives us the
    starting cluster number for that file: cluster 2. To find the
    logical-sector number of the first block in the file, we can follow the
    procedure given earlier:

    1.  Cluster number - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0.

    2.  Multiply by sectors per cluster = 0 * 2 = 0.

    3.  Add logical-sector number of start of the files area = 0 + 0CH = 0CH.

    So the calculated sector number of the beginning of the file IBMBIO.COM is
    0CH, which is exactly what we expect knowing that the FORMAT program
    always places the system files in contiguous sectors at the beginning of
    the data area.

    Now let's trace IBMBIO.COM's chain through the file allocation table
    (Figures 10-9 and 10-10). This will be a little tedious, but a detailed
    understanding of the process is crucial. In an actual program, we would
    first read the boot sector using Int 25H, then calculate the address of
    the FAT from the contents of the BPB, and finally read the FAT into
    memory, again using Int 25H.

    From IBMBIO.COM's directory entry, we already know that the first cluster
    in the file is cluster 2. To examine that cluster's entry in the FAT, we
    multiply the cluster number by 1.5, which gives 0003H as the FAT offset,
    and fetch the word at that offset (which contains 4003H). Because the
    product of the cluster and 1.5 is a whole number, we AND the word from the
    FAT with 0FFFH, yielding the number 3, which is the number of the second
    cluster assigned to the file.

    Figure 10-10.  Assembly-language procedure to access the file allocation
    table (assumes 12-bit FAT fields). Given a cluster number, the procedure
    returns the contents of that cluster's FAT entry in the AX register. This
    simple example ignores the fact that FAT entries can span sector
    boundaries.

    To examine cluster 3's entry in the FAT, we multiply 3 by 1.5, which gives
    4.5, and fetch the word at offset 0004H (which contains 0040H). Because
    the product of 3 and 1.5 is not a whole number, we shift the word right
    4 bits, yielding the number 4, which is the number of the third cluster
    assigned to IBMBIO.COM.

    In this manner, we can follow the chain through the FAT until we come to a
    cluster (number 23, in this case) whose FAT entry contains the value
    0FFFH, which is an end-of-file marker in FATs with 12-bit entries.

    We have now established that the file IBMBIO.COM contains clusters 2
    through 23 (02H─17H), from which we can calculate that logical sectors 0CH
    through 38H are assigned to the file. Of course, the last cluster may be
    only partially filled with actual data; the portion of the last cluster
    used is the remainder of the file's size in bytes (found in the directory
    entry) divided by the bytes per cluster.

    Fixed disks have another layer of organization beyond the logical volume
    structure already discussed: partitions. The FDISK utility divides a fixed
    disk into one or more partitions consisting of an integral number of
    cylinders. Each partition can contain an independent file system and, for
    that matter, its own copy of an operating system.

    The first physical sector on a fixed disk (track 0, head 0, sector 1)
    contains the master boot record, which is laid out as follows:

    Bytes              Contents
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    000─1BDH           Reserved
    1BE─1CDH           Partition #1 descriptor
    1CE─1DDH           Partition #2 descriptor
    1DE─1EDH           Partition #3 descriptor
    1EE─1FDH           Partition #4 descriptor
    1FE─1FFH           Signature word (AA55H)
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    The partition descriptors in the master boot record define the size,
    location, and type of each partition, as follows:

    Byte(s)            Contents
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    00H                Active flag (0 = not bootable, 80H = bootable)
    01H                Starting head
    02H─03H            Starting cylinder/sector
    04H                Partition type
    00H                not used
    01H                FAT file system, 12-bit FAT entries
    04H                FAT file system, 16-bit FAT entries
    05H                extended partition
    06H                "huge partition" (MS-DOS versions 4.0 and later)
    05H                Ending head
    06H─07H            Ending cylinder/sector
    08H─0BH            Starting sector for partition, relative to beginning of
                        disk
    0CH─0FH            Partition length in sectorsThe active flag, which
                        indicates that the partition is bootable, can be set on
                        only one partition at a time.
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    MS-DOS treats partition types 1, 4, and 6 as normal logical volumes and
    assigns them their own drive identifiers during the system boot process.
    Partition type 5 can contain multiple logical volumes and has a special
    extended boot record that describes each volume. The FORMAT utility
    initializes MS-DOS fixed-disk partitions, creating the file system within
    the partition (boot record, file allocation table, root directory, and
    files area) and optionally placing a bootable copy of the operating system
    in the file system.

    Figure 10-11 contains a partial hex dump of a master block from a fixed
    disk formatted under PC-DOS version 3.3. This dump illustrates the
    partition descriptors for a normal partition with a 16-bit FAT and an
    extended partition.

Chapter 11  Memory Management

    Current versions of MS-DOS can manage as much as 1 megabyte of contiguous
    random-access memory. On IBM PCs and compatibles, the memory occupied by
    MS-DOS and other programs starts at address 0000H and may reach as high as
    address 09FFFFH; this 640 KB area of RAM is sometimes referred to as
    conventional memory. Memory above this address is reserved for ROM
    hardware drivers, video refresh buffers, and the like. Computers that are
    not IBM compatible may use other memory layouts.

    The RAM area under the control of MS-DOS is divided into two major
    sections:

    ■  The operating-system area

    ■  The transient-program area

    The operating-system area starts at address 0000H──that is, it occupies
    the lowest portion of RAM. It holds the interrupt vector table, the
    operating system proper and its tables and buffers, any additional
    installable drivers specified in the CONFIG.SYS file, and the resident
    part of the COMMAND.COM command interpreter. The amount of memory occupied
    by the operating-system area varies with the version of MS-DOS used, the
    number of disk buffers, the size of installed device drivers, and so
    forth.

    The transient-program area (TPA), sometimes called the memory arena, is
    the remainder of memory above the operating-system area. The memory arena
    is dynamically allocated in blocks called arena entries. Each arena entry
    has a special control structure called an arena header, and all of the
    arena headers are chained together. Three MS-DOS Int 21H functions allow
    programs to allocate, resize, and release blocks of memory from the TPA:

    Function                 Action
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    48H                     Allocate memory block.
    49H                     Release memory block.
    4AH                     Resize memory block.
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    MS-DOS itself uses these functions when loading a program from disk at the
    request of COMMAND.COM or another program. The EXEC function, which is the
    MS-DOS program loader, calls Int 21H Function 48H to allocate a memory
    block for the loaded program's environment and another for the program
    itself and its program segment prefix. It then reads the program from the
    disk into the assigned memory area. When the program terminates, MS-DOS
    calls Int 21H Function 49H to release all memory owned by the program.

    Transient programs can also employ the MS-DOS memory-management functions
    to dynamically manage the memory available in the TPA. Proper use of these
    functions is one of the most important criteria of whether a program is
    well behaved under MS-DOS. Well-behaved programs are most likely to be
    portable to future versions of the operating system and least likely to
    cause interference with other processes under multitasking user interfaces
    such as Microsoft Windows.


Using the Memory-Allocation Functions

    The memory-allocation functions have two common uses:

    ■  To shrink a program's initial memory allocation so that there is enough
        room to load and execute another program under its control.

    ■  To dynamically allocate additional memory required by the program and
        to release the same memory when it is no longer needed.

Shrinking the Initial Memory Allocation

    Although many MS-DOS application programs simply assume they own all
    memory, this assumption is a relic of MS-DOS version 1 (and CP/M), which
    could support only one active process at a time. Well-behaved MS-DOS
    programs take pains to modify only memory that they actually own and to
    release any memory that they don't need.

    Unfortunately, under current versions of MS-DOS, the amount of memory that
    a program will own is not easily predicted in advance. It turns out that
    the amount of memory allocated to a program when it is first loaded
    depends upon two factors:

    ■  The type of file the program is loaded from

    ■  The amount of memory available in the TPA

    MS-DOS always allocates all of the largest available memory block in the
    TPA to programs loaded from .COM (memory-image) files. Because .COM
    programs contain no file header that can pass segment and memory-use
    information to MS-DOS, MS-DOS simply assumes the worst case and gives such
    a program everything. MS-DOS will load the program as long as there is an
    available memory block as large as the size of the file plus 256 bytes for
    the PSP and 2 bytes for the stack. The .COM program, when it receives
    control, must determine whether enough memory is available to carry out
    its functions.

    MS-DOS uses more complicated rules to allocate memory to programs loaded
    from .EXE files. First, of course, a memory block large enough to hold the
    declared code, data, and stack segments must be available in the TPA. In
    addition, the linker sets two fields in a .EXE file's header to inform
    MS-DOS about the program's memory requirements. The first field,
    MIN_ALLOC, defines the minimum number of paragraphs required by the
    program, in addition to those for the code, data, and stack segments. The
    second, MAX_ALLOC, defines the maximum number of paragraphs of additional
    memory the program would use if they were available.

    When loading a .EXE file, MS-DOS first attempts to allocate the number of
    paragraphs in MAX_ALLOC plus the number of paragraphs required by the
    program itself. If that much memory is not available, MS-DOS assigns all
    of the largest available block to the program, provided that this is at
    least the amount specified by MIN_ALLOC plus the size of the program
    image. If that condition is not satisfied, the program cannot be executed.

    After a .COM or .EXE program is loaded and running, it can use Int 21H
    Function 4AH (Resize Memory Block) to release all the memory it does not
    immediately need. This is conveniently done right after the program
    receives control from MS-DOS, by calling the resize function with the
    segment of the program's PSP in the ES register and the number of
    paragraphs that the program requires to run in the BX register (Figure
    11-1).

    Figure 11-1.  An example of a .COM program releasing excess memory after
    it receives control from MS-DOS. Int 21H Function 4AH is called with ES
    pointing to the program's PSP and BX containing the number of paragraphs
    that the program needs to execute. In this case, the new size for the
    program's memory block is calculated as the program image size plus the
    size of the PSP (256 bytes), rounded up to the next paragraph. .EXE
    programs use similar code.

Dynamic Allocation of Additional Memory

    When a well-behaved program needs additional memory space──for an I/O
    buffer or an array of intermediate results, for example──it can call Int
    21H Function 48H (Allocate Memory Block) with the desired number of
    paragraphs. If a sufficiently large block of unallocated memory is
    available, MS-DOS returns the segment address of the base of the assigned
    area and clears the carry flag (0), indicating that the function was
    successful.

    If no unallocated block of sufficient size is available, MS-DOS sets the
    carry flag (1), returns an error code in the AX register, and returns the
    size (in paragraphs) of the largest block available in the BX register
    (Figure 11-2). In this case, no memory has yet been allocated. The
    program can use the value returned in the BX register to determine whether
    it can continue in a "degraded" fashion, with less memory. If it can, it
    must call Int 21H Function 48H again to allocate the smaller memory
    block.

    When the MS-DOS memory manager is searching the chain of arena headers to
    satisfy a memory-allocation request, it can use one of the following
    strategies:

    ■  First fit: Use the arena entry at the lowest address that is large
        enough to satisfy the request.

    ■  Best fit: Use the smallest arena entry that will satisfy the request,
        regardless of its location.

    ■  Last fit: Use the arena entry at the highest address that is large
        enough to satisfy the request.

    Figure 11-2.  Example of dynamic memory allocation. The program requests a
    32 KB memory block from MS-DOS, fills it with -1s, writes it to disk, and
    then releases it.

    If the arena entry selected is larger than the size requested, MS-DOS
    divides it into two parts: one block of the size requested, which is
    assigned to the program that called Int 21H Function 48H, and an unowned
    block containing the remaining memory.

    The default MS-DOS allocation strategy is first fit. However, under MS-DOS
    versions 3.0 and later, an application program can change the strategy
    with Int 21H Function 58H.

    When a program is through with an allocated memory block, it should use
    Int 21H Function 49H to release the block. If it does not, MS-DOS will
    automatically release all memory allocations for the program when it
    terminates.


Arena Headers

    Microsoft has not officially documented the internal structure of arena
    headers for the outside world at present. This is probably to deter
    programmers from trying to manipulate their memory allocations directly
    instead of through the MS-DOS functions provided for that purpose.

    Arena headers have identical structures in MS-DOS versions 2 and 3. They
    are 16 bytes (one paragraph) and are located immediately before the memory
    area that they control (Figure 11-3). An arena header contains the
    following information:

    ■  A byte signifying whether the header is a member or the last entry in
        the entire chain of such headers

    ■  A word indicating whether the area it controls is available or whether
        it already belongs to a program (if the latter, the word points to the
        program's PSP)

    ■  A word indicating the size (in paragraphs) of the controlled memory
        area (arena entry)

    MS-DOS inspects the chain of arena headers whenever the program requests a
    memory-block allocation, modification, or release function, or when a
    program is EXEC'd or terminated. If any of the blocks appear to be
    corrupted or if the chain is broken, MS-DOS displays the dreaded message

    Memory allocation error

    and halts the system.

    In the example illustrated in Figure 11-3, COMMAND.COM originally loaded
    PROGRAM1.COM into the TPA and, because it was a .COM file, COMMAND.COM
    allocated it all of the TPA, controlled by arena header #1. PROGRAM1.COM
    then used Int 21H Function 4AH (Resize Memory Block) to shrink its memory
    allocation to the amount it actually needed to run and loaded and executed
    PROGRAM2.EXE with the EXEC function (Int 21H Function 4BH). The EXEC
    function obtained a suitable amount of memory, controlled by arena header
    #2, and loaded PROGRAM2.EXE into it. PROGRAM2.EXE, in turn, needed some
    additional memory to store some intermediate results, so it called Int 21H
    Function 48H (Allocate Memory Block) to obtain the area controlled by
    arena header #3. The highest arena header (#4) controls all of the
    remaining TPA that has not been allocated to any program.

Lotus/Intel/Microsoft Expanded Memory

    When the IBM Personal Computer and MS-DOS were first released, the 640 KB
    limit that IBM placed on the amount of RAM that could be directly managed
    by MS-DOS seemed almost unimaginably huge. But as MS-DOS has grown in both
    size and capabilities and the popular applications have become more
    powerful, that 640 KB has begun to seem a bit crowded. Although personal
    computers based on the 80286 and 80386 have the potential to manage up to
    16 megabytes of RAM under operating systems such as MS OS/2 and XENIX,
    this is little comfort to the millions of users of 8086/8088-based
    computers and MS-DOS.

    At the spring COMDEX in 1985, Lotus Development Corporation and Intel
    Corporation jointly announced the Expanded Memory Specification 3.0 (EMS),
    which was designed to head off rapid obsolescence of the older PCs because
    of limited memory. Shortly afterward, Microsoft announced that it would
    support the EMS and would enhance Microsoft Windows to use the memory made
    available by EMS hardware and software. EMS versions 3.2 and 4.0, released
    in fall 1985 and summer 1987, expanded support for multitasking operating
    systems.

    The LIM EMS (as it is usually known) has been an enormous success. EMS
    memory boards are available from scores of manufacturers, and "EMS-aware"
    software──especially spreadsheets, disk caches, and terminate-and-stay-
    resident utilities──has become the rule rather than the exception.

What Is Expanded Memory?

    The Lotus/Intel/Microsoft Expanded Memory Specification is a functional
    definition of a bank-switched memory-expansion subsystem. It consists of
    hardware expansion modules and a resident driver program specific to those
    modules. In EMS versions 3.0 and 3.2, the expanded memory is made
    available to application software as 16 KB pages mapped into a contiguous
    64 KB area called the page frame, somewhere above the main memory area
    used by MS-DOS/PC-DOS (0─640 KB). The exact location of the page frame is
    user configurable, so it need not conflict with other hardware options. In
    EMS version 4.0, the pages may be mapped anywhere in memory and can have
    sizes other than 16 KB.

    The EMS provides a uniform means for applications to access as much as 8
    megabytes of memory (32 megabytes in EMS 4.0). The supporting software,
    which is called the Expanded Memory Manager (EMM), provides a
    hardware-independent interface between application software and the
    expanded memory board(s). The EMM is supplied in the form of an
    installable device driver that you link into the MS-DOS/PC-DOS system by
    adding a line to the CONFIG.SYS file on the system boot disk.

    Internally, the Expanded Memory Manager consists of two major portions,
    which may be referred to as the driver and the manager. The driver portion
    mimics some of the actions of a genuine installable device driver, in that
    it includes initialization and output status functions and a valid device
    header. The second, and major, portion of the EMM is the true interface
    between application software and the expanded-memory hardware. Several
    classes of services are provided:

    ■  Verification of functionality of hardware and software modules

    ■  Allocation of expanded-memory pages

    ■  Mapping of logical pages into the physical page frame

    ■  Deallocation of expanded-memory pages

    ■  Support for multitasking operating systems

    Application programs communicate with the EMM directly, by means of
    software Int 67H. MS-DOS versions 3.3 and earlier take no part in (and in
    fact are completely oblivious to) any expanded-memory manipulations that
    may occur. MS-DOS version 4.0 and Microsoft Windows, on the other hand,
    are "EMS-aware" and can use the EMS memory when it is available.

    Expanded memory should not be confused with extended memory. Extended
    memory is the term used by IBM to refer to the memory at physical
    addresses above 1 megabyte that can be accessed by an 80286 or 80386 CPU
    in protected mode. Current versions of MS-DOS run the 80286 and 80386 in
    real mode (8086-emulation mode), and extended memory is therefore not
    directly accessible.

Checking for Expanded Memory

    An application program can use either of two methods to test for the
    existence of the Expanded Memory Manager:

    ■  Issue an open request (Int 21H Function 3DH) using the guaranteed
        device name of the EMM driver: EMMXXXX0. If the open function succeeds,
        either the driver is present or a file with the same name
        coincidentally exists on the default disk drive. To rule out the
        latter, the application can use IOCTL (Int 21H Function 44H)
        subfunctions 00H and 07H to ensure that EMM is present. In either case,
        the application should then use Int 21H Function 3EH to close the
        handle that was obtained from the open function, so that the handle can
        be reused for another file or device.

    ■  Use the address that is found in the Int 67H vector to inspect the
        device header of the presumed EMM. Interrupt handlers and device
        drivers must use this method. If the EMM is present, the name field at
        offset 0AH of the device header contains the string EMMXXXX0. This
        approach is nearly foolproof and avoids the relatively high overhead of
        an MS-DOS open function. However, it is somewhat less well behaved
        because it involves inspection of memory that does not belong to the
        application.

    These two methods of testing for the existence of the Expanded Memory
    Manager are illustrated in Figures 11-4 and 11-5.

Using Expanded Memory

    After establishing that the memory-manager software is present, the
    application program communicates with it directly by means of the "user
    interrupt" 67H, bypassing MS-DOS/PC-DOS. The calling sequence for the EMM
    is as follows:

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                    mov  ah,function            ; AH determines service type
                    .                           ; load other registers with
                    .                           ; values specific to the
                    .                           ; requested service
                    int  67h
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    In general, AH contains the EMM function number, AL holds the subfunction
    number (if any), BX holds a number of pages (if applicable), and DX
    contains an EMM handle. Registers DS:SI and ES:DI are used to pass the
    addresses of arrays or buffers. Section 4 of this book,
    "Lotus/Intel/Microsoft EMS Functions Reference," details each of the
    expanded memory functions.

    Upon return from an EMM function, the AH register contains zero if the
    function was successful; otherwise, it contains an error code with the
    most significant bit set (Figures 11-6 and 11-7). Other values are
    typically returned in the AL and BX registers or in a user-specified
    buffer.

    Figure 11-7.  Expanded Memory Manager error codes unique to EMS version
    4.0. Most of these errors are related to the EMS functions for use by
    operating systems and would not normally be encountered by application
    programs.

    An application program that uses expanded memory should regard that memory
    as a system resource, like a file or a device, and employ only the
    documented EMM services to allocate, access, and release expanded-memory
    pages. Such a program can use the following general strategy:

    1.  Establish the presence of the Expanded Memory Manager by one of the
        two methods demonstrated in Figures 11-4 and 11-5.

    2.  After the driver is known to be present, check its operational status
        with EMS Function 40H.

    3.  Check the version number of EMM with EMS Function 46H, to ensure that
        all services the application will request are available.

    4.  Obtain the segment of the page frame used by EMM with EMS Function
        41H.

    5.  Allocate the desired number of expanded-memory pages with EMS Function
        43H. If the allocation is successful, EMM returns a handle that the
        application can use to refer to the expanded-memory pages that it
        owns. This step is exactly analogous to opening a file and using the
        handle obtained from the open function for read/write operations on
        the file.

    6.  If the requested number of pages are not available, the application
        can query EMM for the actual number of pages available (EMS Function
        42H) and determine whether it can continue.

    7.  After the application has successfully allocated the needed number of
        expanded-memory pages, it uses EMS Function 44H to map logical pages
        in and out of the physical page frame in order to store and retrieve
        data in expanded memory.

    8.  When the program finishes using its expanded-memory pages, it must
        release them by calling EMS Function 45H. Otherwise, the pages will
        be lost to use by other programs until the system is restarted.

    Figure 11-8 shows a skeleton program that illustrates this general
    approach.

    An interrupt handler or device driver that uses EMS follows the same
    general procedure outlined in steps 1 through 8, with a few minor
    variations. It may need to acquire an EMS handle and allocate pages before
    the operating system is fully functional; in particular, you cannot assume
    that the MS-DOS Open File or Device, IOCTL, and Get Interrupt Vector
    functions are available. Thus, such a handler or driver must use a
    modified version of the "get interrupt vector" technique (Figure 11-5) to
    test for the existence of EMM, fetching the contents of the Int 67H vector
    directly.

    A device driver or interrupt handler typically owns its expanded-memory
    pages permanently (until the system is restarted) and never deallocates
    them. Such a program must also take care to save and restore EMM's
    page-mapping context (EMS Functions 47H and 48H) whenever it accesses
    expanded memory, so that use of EMS by a foreground program will not
    be disturbed.

    The EMM relies on the good behavior of application software to avoid the
    corruption of expanded memory. If several applications that use expanded
    memory are running under a multitasking manager such as Microsoft Windows
    and one or more of them does not abide strictly by EMM conventions, the
    data of some or all of the applications may be destroyed.

    expanded memory.


Extended Memory

    Extended memory is RAM storage at addresses above 1 megabyte (100000H)
    that can be accessed by an 80286 or 80386 processor running in protected
    mode. IBM PC/AT─ and PS/2─compatible machines can (theoretically) have as
    much as 15 MB of extended memory installed, in addition to the usual 1 MB
    of conventional memory.

    Protected-mode operating systems such as Microsoft XENIX or MS OS/2 can
    use extended memory for execution of programs. MS-DOS, on the other hand,
    runs in real mode on an 80286 or 80386, and programs running under its
    control cannot ordinarily execute from extended memory or even address
    that memory for storage of data. However, the ROM BIOS contains two
    routines that allow real-mode programs restricted access to extended
    memory:

    ROM BIOS function                    Action
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Int 15H Function 87H                Move extended-memory block.
    Int 15H Function 88H                Get extended-memory size.
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    These routines can be used by electronic disks (RAMdisks) and by other
    programs that want to use extended memory for fast storage and retrieval
    of information that would otherwise have to be written to a slower
    physical disk drive. Section 3 of this book, "IBM ROM BIOS and Mouse
    Functions Reference," documents both of these functions.

    You should use these ROM BIOS routines with caution. Data stored in
    extended memory is, of course, volatile; it is lost if the machine is
    turned off. The transfer of data to or from extended memory involves a
    switch from real mode to protected mode and back, which is a relatively
    slow process on 80286-based machines; in some cases it is only marginally
    faster than actually reading the data from a fixed disk. In addition,
    programs that use the ROM BIOS extended-memory functions are not
    compatible with the MS-DOS compatibility mode of MS OS/2.

    Finally, a major deficit in these ROM BIOS functions is that they do not
    make any attempt to arbitrate between two or more programs or drivers that
    are using extended memory for temporary storage. For example, if an
    application program and an installed RAMdisk driver attempt to put data in
    the same area of extended memory, no error will be returned to either
    program, but the data of one or both may be destroyed.

    Figure 11-9 shows an example of the code necessary to transfer data to
    and from extended memory.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Chapter 12  The EXEC Function

    The MS-DOS EXEC function (Int 21H Function 4BH) allows a program (called
    the parent) to load any other program (called the child) from a storage
    device, execute it, and then regain control when the child program is
    finished.

    A parent program can pass information to the child in a command line, in
    default file control blocks, and by means of a set of strings called the
    environment block (discussed later in this chapter). All files or devices
    that the parent opened using the handle file-management functions are
    duplicated in the newly created child task; that is, the child inherits
    all the active handles of the parent task. Any file operations on those
    handles by the child, such as seeks or file I/O, also affect the file
    pointers associated with the parent's handles.

    MS-DOS suspends execution of the parent program until the child program
    terminates. When the child program finishes its work, it can pass an exit
    code back to the parent, indicating whether it encountered any errors. It
    can also, in turn, load other programs, and so on through many levels of
    control, until the system runs out of memory.

    The MS-DOS command interpreter, COMMAND.COM, uses the EXEC function to run
    its external commands and other application programs. Many popular
    commercial programs, such as database managers and word processors, use
    EXEC to run other programs (spelling checkers, for example) or to load a
    second copy of COMMAND.COM, thereby allowing the user to list directories
    or copy and rename files without closing all the application files and
    stopping the main work in progress. EXEC can also be used to load program
    overlay segments, although this use is uncommon.


Making Memory Available

    In order for a parent program to use the EXEC function to load a child
    program, sufficient unallocated memory must be available in the transient
    program area.

    When the parent itself was loaded, MS-DOS allocated it a variable amount
    of memory, depending upon its original file type──.COM or .EXE──and any
    other information that was available to the loader. (See Chapter 11 for
    further details.) Because the operating system has no foolproof way of
    predicting how much memory any given program will require, it generally
    allocates far more memory to a program than is really necessary.

    Therefore, a prospective parent program's first action should be to use
    Int 21H Function 4AH (Resize Memory Block) to release any excess memory
    allocation of its own to MS-DOS. In this case, the program should call Int
    21H Function 4AH with the ES register pointing to the program segment
    prefix of the program releasing memory and the BX register containing the
    number of paragraphs of memory to retain for that program. (See Figure
    11-1 for an example.)

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    WARNING
    A .COM program must move its stack to a safe area if it is reducing its
    memory allocation to less than 64 KB.
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Requesting the EXEC Function

    To load and execute a child program, the parent must execute an Int 21H
    with the registers set up as follows:

    AH = 4BH
    AL = 00H (subfunction to load child program)
    DS:DX = segment:offset of pathname for child program
    ES:BX = segment:offset of parameter block

    The parameter block, in turn, contains addresses of other information
    needed by the EXEC function.

The Program Name

    The name of the program to be run, which the calling program provides to
    the EXEC function, must be an unambiguous file specification (no wildcard
    characters) and must include an explicit .COM or .EXE extension. If the
    path and disk drive are not supplied in the program name, MS-DOS uses the
    current directory and default disk drive. (The sequential search for .COM,
    .EXE, and .BAT files in all the locations listed in the PATH variable is
    not a function of EXEC, but rather of the internal logic of COMMAND.COM.)

    You cannot EXEC a batch file directly; instead, you must EXEC a copy of
    COMMAND.COM and pass the name of the batch file in the command tail, along
    with the /C switch.

The Parameter Block

    The parameter block contains the addresses of four data objects:

    ■  The environment block

    ■  The command tail

    ■  Two default file control blocks

    The space reserved in the parameter block for the address of the
    environment block is only 2 bytes and holds a segment address. The
    remaining three addresses are all double-word addresses; that is, they are
    4 bytes, with the offset in the first 2 bytes and the segment address in
    the last 2 bytes.

    The Environment Block

    Each program that the EXEC function loads inherits a data structure called
    an environment block from its parent. The pointer to the segment of the
    block is at offset 002CH in the PSP. The environment block holds certain
    information used by the system's command interpreter (usually COMMAND.COM)
    and may also hold information to be used by transient programs. It has no
    effect on the operation of the operating system proper.

    If the environment-block pointer in the EXEC parameter block contains
    zero, the child program acquires a copy of the parent program's
    environment block. Alternatively, the parent program can provide a segment
    pointer to a different or expanded environment. The maximum size of the
    environment block is 32 KB, so very large chunks of information can be
    passed between programs by this mechanism.

    The environment block for any given program is static, implying that if
    more than one generation of child programs is resident in RAM, each one
    will have a distinct and separate copy of the environment block.
    Furthermore, the environment block for a program that terminates and stays
    resident is not updated by subsequent PATH and SET commands.

    You will find more details about the environment block later in this
    chapter.

    The Command Tail

    MS-DOS copies the command tail into the child program's PSP at offset
    0080H, as described in Chapter 3. The information takes the form of a
    count byte, followed by a string of ASCII characters, terminated by a
    carriage return; the carriage return is not included in the count.

    The command tail can include filenames, switches, or other parameters.
    From the child program's point of view, the command tail should provide
    the same information that would be present if the program had been run by
    a direct user command at the MS-DOS prompt. EXEC ignores any
    I/O-redirection parameters placed in the command tail; the parent program
    must provide for redirection of the standard devices before the EXEC
    call is made.

    The Default File Control Blocks

    MS-DOS copies the two default file control blocks pointed to by the EXEC
    parameter block into the child program's PSP at offsets 005CH and 006CH.
    To emulate the function of COMMAND.COM from the child program's point of
    view, the parent program should use Int 21H Function 29H (the system
    parse-filename service) to parse the first two parameters of the command
    tail into the default file control blocks before invoking the EXEC
    function.

    File control blocks are not much use under MS-DOS versions 2 and 3,
    because they do not support the hierarchical file structure, but some
    application programs do inspect them as a quick way to get at the first
    two switches or other parameters in the command tail. Chapter 8 discusses
    file control blocks in more detail.


Returning from the EXEC Function

    In MS-DOS version 2, the EXEC function destroys the contents of all
    registers except the code segment (CS) and instruction pointer (IP).
    Therefore, before making the EXEC call, the parent program must push the
    contents of any other registers that are important onto the stack and then
    save the stack segment (SS) and stack pointer (SP) registers in variables.
    Upon return from a successful EXEC call (that is, the child program has
    finished executing), the parent program should reload SS and SP from the
    variables where they were saved and then pop the other saved registers off
    the stack. In MS-DOS versions 3.0 and later, the stack and other registers
    are preserved across the EXEC call in the usual fashion.

    Finally, the parent can use Int 21H Function 4DH to obtain the
    termination type and return code of the child program.

    The EXEC function will fail under the following conditions:

    ■  Not enough unallocated memory is available to load and execute the
        requested program file.

    ■  The requested program can't be found on the disk.

    ■  The transient portion of COMMAND.COM in highest RAM (which contains the
        actual loader) has been destroyed and not enough free memory is
        available to reload it (PC-DOS version 2 only).

    Figure 12-1 summarizes the calling convention for function 4BH. Figure
    12-2 shows a skeleton of a typical EXEC call. This particular example
    uses the EXEC function to load and run the MS-DOS utility CHKDSK.COM. The
    SHELL.ASM program listing later in this chapter (Figure 12-5) presents a
    more complete example that includes the use of Int 21H Function 4AH to

    Figure 12-2.  A brief example of the use of the MS-DOS EXEC call, with all
    necessary variables and command blocks. Note the protection of the
    registers for MS-DOS version 2 and the masking of interrupts during
    loading of SS:SP to circumvent a bug in some early 8088 CPUs.


More About the Environment Block

    The environment block is always paragraph aligned (starts at an address
    that is a multiple of 16 bytes) and contains a series of ASCIIZ strings.
    Each of the strings takes the following form:

    NAME=PARAMETER

    An additional zero byte (Figure 12-3) indicates the end of the entire set
    of strings. Under MS-DOS version 3, the block of environment strings and
    the extra zero byte are followed by a word count and the complete drive,
    path, filename, and extension used by EXEC to load the program.

    Figure 12-3.  Dump of a typical environment block under MS-DOS version 3.
    This particular example contains the default COMSPEC parameter and two
    relatively complex PATH and PROMPT control strings that were set up by
    entries in the user's AUTOEXEC file. Note the path and file specification
    of the executing program following the double zeros at offset 0073H that
    denote the end of the environment block.

    Under normal conditions, the environment block inherited by a program will
    contain at least three strings:

    COMSPEC=variable
    PATH=variable
    PROMPT=variable

    MS-DOS places these three strings into the environment block at system
    initialization, during the interpretation of SHELL, PATH, and PROMPT
    directives in the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. The strings tell the
    MS-DOS command interpreter, COMMAND.COM, the location of its executable
    file (to enable it to reload the transient portion), where to search for
    executable external commands or program files, and the format of the user
    prompt.

    You can add other strings to the environment block, either interactively
    or in batch files, with the SET command. Transient programs can use these
    strings for informational purposes. For example, the Microsoft C Compiler
    looks in the environment block for INCLUDE, LIB, and TMP strings to tell
    it where to find its #include files and library files and where to build
    its temporary working files.


Example Programs: SHELL.C and SHELL.ASM

    As a practical example of use of the MS-DOS EXEC function, I have included
    a small command interpreter called SHELL, with equivalent Microsoft C
    (Figure 12-4) and Microsoft Macro Assembler (Figure 12-5) source code.
    The source code for the assembly-language version is considerably more
    complex than the code for the C version, but the names and functionality
    of the various procedures are quite parallel.

    Figure 12-5.  SHELL.ASM: A simple table-driven command interpreter written
    in Microsoft Macro Assembler.

    The SHELL program is table driven and can easily be extended to provide a
    powerful customized user interface for almost any application. When SHELL
    takes control of the system, it displays the prompt

    sh:

    and waits for input from the user. After the user types a line terminated
    by a carriage return, SHELL tries to match the first token in the line
    against its table of internal (intrinsic) commands. If it finds a match,
    it calls the appropriate subroutine. If it does not find a match, it calls
    the MS-DOS EXEC function and passes the user's input to COMMAND.COM with
    the /C switch, essentially using COMMAND.COM as a transient command
    processor under its own control.

    As supplied in these listings, SHELL "knows" exactly three internal
    commands:

    Command            Action
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    CLS                Uses the ANSI standard control sequence to clear the
                        display screen and home the cursor.
    DOS                Runs a copy of COMMAND.COM.
    EXIT               Exits SHELL, returning control of the system to the
                        next lower command interpreter.
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    You can quickly add new intrinsic commands to either the C version or the
    assembly-language version of SHELL. Simply code a procedure with the
    appropriate action and insert the name of that procedure, along with the
    text string that defines the command, into the table COMMANDS. In
    addition, you can easily prevent SHELL from passing certain "dangerous"
    commands (such as MKDIR or ERASE) to COMMAND.COM simply by putting the
    names of the commands to be screened out into the intrinsic command table
    with the address of a subroutine that prints an error message.

    To summarize, the basic flow of both versions of the SHELL program is
    as follows:

    1.  The program calls MS-DOS Int 21H Function 4AH (Resize Memory Block)
        to shrink its memory allocation, so that the maximum possible space
        will be available for COMMAND.COM if it is run as an overlay. (This is
        explicit in the assembly-language version only. To keep the example
        code simple, the number of paragraphs to be reserved is coded as a
        generous literal value, rather than being figured out at runtime from
        the size and location of the various program segments.)

    2.  The program searches the environment for the COMSPEC variable, which
        defines the location of an executable copy of COMMAND.COM. If it can't
        find the COMSPEC variable, it prints an error message and exits.

    3.  The program puts the address of its own handler in the Ctrl-C vector
        (Int 23H) so that it won't lose control if the user enters a Ctrl-C
        or a Ctrl-Break.

    4.  The program issues a prompt to the standard output device.

    5.  The program reads a buffered line from the standard input device to
        get the user's command.

    6.  The program matches the first blank-delimited token in the line
        against its table of intrinsic commands. If it finds a match, it
        executes the associated procedure.

    7.  If the program does not find a match in the table of intrinsic
        commands, it synthesizes a command-line tail by appending the user's
        input to the /C switch and then EXECs a copy of COMMAND.COM, passing
        the address of the synthesized command tail in the EXEC parameter
        block.

    8.  The program repeats steps 4 through 7 until the user enters the
        command EXIT, which is one of the intrinsic commands, and which causes
        SHELL to terminate execution.

    In its present form, SHELL allows COMMAND.COM to inherit a full copy of
    the current environment. However, in some applications it may be helpful,
    or safer, to pass a modified copy of the environment block so that the
    secondary copy of COMMAND.COM will not have access to certain information.


Using EXEC to Load Overlays

    Loading overlays with the EXEC function is much less complex than using
    EXEC to run another program. The overlay can be constructed as either a
    memory image (.COM) or relocatable (.EXE) file and need not be the same
    type as the program that loads it. The main program, called the root
    segment, must carry out the following steps to load and execute an
    overlay:

    1.  Make a memory block available to receive the overlay. The program that
        calls EXEC must own the memory block for the overlay.

    2.  Set up the overlay parameter block to be passed to the EXEC function.
        This block contains the segment address of the block that will receive
        the overlay, plus a segment relocation value to be applied to the
        contents of the overlay file (if it is a .EXE file). These are
        normally the same value.

    3.  Call the MS-DOS EXEC function to load the overlay by issuing an Int
        21H with the registers set up as follows:

        AH = 4BH
        AL = 03H (EXEC subfunction to load overlay)
        DS:DX = segment:offset of overlay file pathname
        ES:BX = segment:offset of overlay parameter block

        Upon return from the EXEC function, the carry flag is clear if the
        overlay was found and loaded. The carry flag is set if the file could
        not be found or if some other error occurred.

    4.  Execute the code within the overlay by transferring to it with a far
        call. The overlay should be designed so that either the entry point or
        a pointer to the entry point is at the beginning of the module after
        it is loaded. This technique allows you to maintain the root and
        overlay modules separately, because the root module does not contain
        any "magical" knowledge of addresses within the overlay segment.

    To prevent users from inadvertently running an overlay directly from the
    command line, you should assign overlay files an extension other than .COM
    or .EXE. It is most convenient to relate overlays to their root segment by
    assigning them the same filename but a different extension, such as .OVL
    or .OV1, .OV2, and so on.

    Figure 12-6 shows the use of EXEC to load and execute an overlay.

Chapter 13  Interrupt Handlers

    Interrupts are signals that cause the computer's central processing unit
    to suspend what it is doing and transfer to a program called an interrupt
    handler. Special hardware mechanisms that are designed for maximum speed
    force the transfer. The interrupt handler determines the cause of the
    interrupt, takes the appropriate action, and then returns control to the
    original process that was suspended.

    Interrupts are typically caused by events external to the central
    processor that require immediate attention, such as the following:

    ■  Completion of an I/O operation

    ■  Detection of a hardware failure

    ■  "Catastrophes" (power failures, for example)

    In order to service interrupts more efficiently, most modern processors
    support multiple interrupt types, or levels. Each type usually has a
    reserved location in memory, called an interrupt vector, that specifies
    where the interrupt-handler program for that interrupt type is located.
    This design speeds processing of an interrupt because the computer can
    transfer control directly to the appropriate routine; it does not need a
    central routine that wastes precious machine cycles determining the cause
    of the interrupt. The concept of interrupt types also allows interrupts to
    be prioritized, so that if several interrupts occur simultaneously, the
    most important one can be processed first.

    CPUs that support interrupts must also have the capability to block
    interrupts while they are executing critical sections of code. Sometimes
    the CPU can block interrupt levels selectively, but more frequently the
    effect is global. While an interrupt is being serviced, the CPU masks all
    other interrupts of the same or lower priority until the active handler
    has completed its execution; similarly, it can preempt the execution of a
    handler if a different interrupt with higher priority requires service.
    Some CPUs can even draw a distinction between selectively masking
    interrupts (they are recognized, but their processing is deferred) and
    simply disabling them (the interrupt is thrown away).

    The creation of interrupt handlers has traditionally been considered one
    of the most arcane of programming tasks, suitable only for the elite cadre
    of system hackers. In reality, writing an interrupt handler is, in itself,
    straightforward. Although the exact procedure must, of course, be
    customized for the characteristics of the particular CPU and operating
    system, the guidelines on the following page are applicable to almost any
    computer system.

    A program preparing to handle interrupts must do the following:

    1.  Disable interrupts, if they were previously enabled, to prevent them
        from occurring while interrupt vectors are being modified.

    2.  Initialize the vector for the interrupt of interest to point to the
        program's interrupt handler.

    3.  Ensure that, if interrupts were previously disabled, all other vectors
        point to some valid handler routine.

    4.  Enable interrupts again.

    The interrupt handler itself must follow a simple but rigid sequence of
    steps:

    1.  Save the system context (registers, flags, and anything else that the
        handler will modify and that wasn't saved automatically by the CPU).

    2.  Block any interrupts that might cause interference if they were
        allowed to occur during this handler's processing. (This is often done
        automatically by the computer hardware.)

    3.  Enable any interrupts that should still be allowed to occur during
        this handler's processing.

    4.  Determine the cause of the interrupt.

    5.  Take the appropriate action for the interrupt: receive and store data
        from the serial port, set a flag to indicate the completion of a
        disk-sector transfer, and so forth.

    6.  Restore the system context.

    7.  Reenable any interrupt levels that were blocked during this handler's
        execution.

    8.  Resume execution of the interrupted process.

    As in writing any other program, the key to success in writing an
    interrupt handler is to program defensively and cover all the bases. The
    main reason interrupt handlers have acquired such a mystical reputation is
    that they are so difficult to debug when they contain obscure errors.
    Because interrupts can occur asynchronously──that is, because they can be
    caused by external events without regard to the state of the currently
    executing process──bugs in interrupt handlers can cause the system as a
    whole to behave quite unpredictably.


Interrupts and the Intel 80x86 Family

    The Intel 80x86 family of microprocessors supports 256 levels of
    prioritized interrupts, which can be triggered by three types of events:

    ■  Internal hardware interrupts

    ■  External hardware interrupts

    ■  Software interrupts

Internal Hardware Interrupts

    Internal hardware interrupts, sometimes called faults, are generated by
    certain events encountered during program execution, such as an attempt to
    divide by zero. The assignment of such events to certain interrupt numbers
    is wired into the processor and is not modifiable (Figure 13-1).

    and 80386 microprocessors.

External Hardware Interrupts

    External hardware interrupts are triggered by peripheral device
    controllers or by coprocessors such as the 8087/80287. These can be tied
    to either the CPU's nonmaskable-interrupt (NMI) pin or its
    maskable-interrupt (INTR) pin. The NMI line is usually reserved for
    interrupts caused by such catastrophic events as a memory parity error or
    a power failure.

    Instead of being wired directly to the CPU, the interrupts from external
    devices can be channeled through a device called the Intel 8259A
    Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC). The CPU controls the PIC through
    a set of I/O ports, and the PIC, in turn, signals the CPU through the INTR
    pin. The PIC allows the interrupts from specific devices to be enabled and
    disabled, and their priorities to be adjusted, under program control.

    A single PIC can handle only eight levels of interrupts. However, PICs can
    be cascaded together in a treelike structure to handle as many levels as
    desired. For example, 80286- and 80386-based machines with a
    PC/AT-compatible architecture use two PICs wired together to obtain 16
    individually configurable levels of interrupts.

    INTR interrupts can be globally enabled and disabled with the CPU's STI
    and CLI instructions. As you would expect, these instructions have no
    effect on interrupts received on the CPU's NMI pin.

    The manufacturer of the computer system and/or the manufacturer of the
    peripheral device assigns external devices to specific 8259A PIC interrupt
    levels. These assignments are realized as physical electrical connections
    and cannot be modified by software.

Software Interrupts

    Any program can trigger software interrupts synchronously simply by
    executing an INT instruction. MS-DOS uses Interrupts 20H through 3FH to
    communicate with its modules and with application programs. (For instance,
    the MS-DOS function dispatcher is reached by executing an Int 21H.) The
    IBM PC ROM BIOS and application software use other interrupts, with either
    higher or lower numbers, for various purposes (Figure 13-2). These
    assignments are simply conventions and are not wired into the hardware in
    any way.

    Figure 13-2.  Interrupts with special significance on the IBM PC, PC/AT,
    and PS/2 and compatible computers. Note that the IBM ROM BIOS uses several
    interrupts in the range 00H─1FH, even though they were reserved by Intel
    for CPU faults. IRQ numbers refer to Intel 8259A PIC priority levels.

The Interrupt-Vector Table

    The bottom 1024 bytes of system memory are called the interrupt-vector
    table. Each 4-byte position in the table corresponds to an interrupt type
    (0 through 0FFH) and contains the segment and offset of the interrupt
    handler for that level. Interrupts 0 through 1FH (the lowest levels) are
    used for internal hardware interrupts; MS-DOS uses Interrupts 20H through
    3FH; all the other interrupts are available for use by either external
    hardware devices or system drivers and application software.

    When an 8259A PIC or other device interrupts the CPU by means of the INTR
    pin, it must also place the interrupt type as an 8-bit number (0 through
    0FFH) on the system bus, where the CPU can find it. The CPU then
    multiplies this number by 4 to find the memory address of the interrupt
    vector to be used.

Servicing an Interrupt

    When the CPU senses an interrupt, it pushes the program status word (which
    defines the various CPU flags), the code segment (CS) register, and the
    instruction pointer (IP) onto the machine stack and disables the interrupt
    system. It then uses the 8-bit number that was jammed onto the system bus
    by the interrupting device to fetch the address of the handler from the
    vector table and resumes execution at that address.

    Usually the handler immediately reenables the interrupt system (to allow
    higher-priority interrupts to occur), saves any registers it is going to
    use, and then processes the interrupt as quickly as possible. Some
    external devices also require a special acknowledgment signal so that they
    will know the interrupt has been recognized.

    If the interrupt was funneled through an 8259A PIC, the handler must send
    a special code called end of interrupt (EOI) to the PIC through its
    control port to tell it when interrupt processing is completed. (The EOI
    has no effect on the CPU itself.) Finally, the handler executes the
    special IRET (INTERRUPT RETURN) instruction that restores the original
    state of the CPU flags, the CS register, and the instruction pointer
    (Figure 13-3).

    Whether an interrupt was triggered by an external device or forced by
    software execution of an INT instruction, there is no discernible
    difference in the system state at the time the interrupt handler receives
    control. This fact is convenient when you are writing and testing external
    interrupt handlers because you can debug them to a large extent simply by
    invoking them with software drivers.

    Figure 13-3.  Typical handler for hardware interrupts on the 80x86 family
    of microprocessors. In real life, the interrupt handler would need to save
    and restore only the registers that it actually modified. Also, if the
    handler made extensive use of the machine stack, it would need to save and
    restore the SS and SP registers of the interrupted process and use its own
    local stack.


Interrupt Handlers and MS-DOS

    The introduction of an interrupt handler into your program brings with it
    considerable hardware dependence. It goes without saying (but I am saying
    it again here anyway) that you should avoid such hardware dependence in
    MS-DOS applications whenever possible, to ensure that your programs will
    be portable to any machine running current versions of MS-DOS and that
    they will run properly under future versions of the operating system.

    Valid reasons do exist, however, for writing your own interrupt handler
    for use under MS-DOS:

    ■  To supersede the MS-DOS default handler for an internal hardware
        interrupt (such as divide-by-zero, BOUND exceeded, and so forth).

    ■  To supersede the MS-DOS default handler for a defined system exception,
        such as the critical-error handler or Ctrl-C handler.

    ■  To chain your own interrupt handler onto the default system handler for
        a hardware device, so that both the system's actions and your own will
        occur on an interrupt. (A typical example of this is the "clock-tick"
        interrupt.)

    ■  To service interrupts not supported by the default MS-DOS device
        drivers (such as the serial communications port, which can be used at
        much higher speeds with interrupts than with polling).

    ■  To provide a path of communication between a program that terminates
        and stays resident and other application software.

    MS-DOS provides the following facilities to enable you to install
    well-behaved interrupt handlers in a manner that does not interfere with
    operating-system functions or other interrupt handlers:

    Function                             Action
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Int 21H Function 25H                Set interrupt vector.
    Int 21H Function 35H                Get interrupt vector.
    Int 21H Function 31H                Terminate and stay resident.
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    These functions allow you to examine or modify the contents of the system
    interrupt-vector table and to reserve memory for the use of a handler
    without running afoul of other processes in the system or causing memory
    use conflicts. Section 2 of this book, "MS-DOS Functions Reference,"
    describes each of these functions in detail, with programming examples.

    Handlers for external hardware interrupts under MS-DOS must operate under
    some fairly severe restrictions:

    ■  Because the current versions of MS-DOS are not reentrant, a hardware
        interrupt handler should never call the MS-DOS functions during the
        actual interrupt processing.

    ■  The handler must reenable interrupts as soon as it gets control, to
        avoid crippling other devices or destroying the accuracy of the system
        clock.

    ■  A program should access the 8259A PIC with great care. The program
        should not access the PIC unless that program is known to be the only
        process in the system concerned with that particular interrupt level.
        And it is vital that the handler issue an end-of-interrupt code to the
        8259A PIC before performing the IRET; otherwise, the processing of
        further interrupts for that priority level or lower priority levels
        will be blocked.

    Restrictions on handlers that replace the MS-DOS default handlers for
    internal hardware interrupts or system exceptions (such as Ctrl-C or
    critical errors) are not quite so stringent, but you must still program
    the handlers with extreme care to avoid destroying system tables or
    leaving the operating system in an unstable state.

    The following are a few rules to keep in mind when you are writing an
    interrupt driver:

    ■  Use Int 21H Function 25H (Set Interrupt Vector) to modify the
        interrupt vector; do not write directly to the interrupt-vector table.

    ■  If your program is not the only process in the system that uses this
        interrupt level, chain back to the previous handler after performing
        your own processing on an interrupt.

    ■  If your program is not going to stay resident, fetch and save the
        current contents of the interrupt vector before modifying it and then
        restore the original contents when your program exits.

    ■  If your program is going to stay resident, use one of the terminate-
        and-stay-resident functions (preferably Int 21H Function 31H) to
        reserve the proper amount of memory for your handler.

    ■  If you are going to process hardware interrupts, keep the time that
        interrupts are disabled and the total length of the service routine to
        an absolute minimum. Remember that even after interrupts are reenabled
        with an STI instruction, interrupts of the same or lower priority
        remain blocked if the interrupt was received through the 8259A PIC.


ZERODIV, an Example Interrupt Handler

    The listing ZERODIV.ASM (Figure 13-4) illustrates some of the principles
    and guidelines on the previous pages. It is an interrupt handler for the
    divide-by-zero internal interrupt (type 0). ZERODIV is loaded as a .COM
    file (usually by a command in the system's AUTOEXEC file) but makes itself
    permanently resident in memory as long as the system is running.

    The ZERODIV program has two major portions: the initialization portion and
    the interrupt handler.

    The initialization procedure (called init in the program listing) is
    executed only once, when the ZERODIV program is executed from the MS-DOS
    level. The init procedure takes over the type 0 interrupt vector, prints a
    sign-on message, then performs a terminate-and-stay-resident exit to
    MS-DOS. This special exit reserves the memory occupied by the ZERODIV
    program, so that it is not overwritten by subsequent application programs.

    The interrupt handler (called zdiv in the program listing) receives
    control when a divide-by-zero interrupt occurs. The handler preserves all
    registers and then prints a message to the user asking whether to continue
    or to abort the program. We can use the MS-DOS console I/O functions
    within this particular interrupt handler because we can safely presume
    that the application was in control when the interrupt occurred; thus,
    there should be no chance of accidentally making overlapping calls upon
    the operating system.

    If the user enters a C to continue, the handler simply restores all the
    registers and performs an IRET (INTERRUPT RETURN) to return control to the
    application. (Of course, the results of the divide operation will be
    useless.) If the user enters Q to quit, the handler exits to MS-DOS. Int
    21H Function 4CH is particularly convenient in this case because it
    allows the program to pass a return code and at the same time is the only
    termination function that does not rely on the contents of any of the
    segment registers.

    For an example of an interrupt handler for external (communications port)
    interrupts, see the TALK terminal-emulator program in Chapter 7. You may
    also want to look again at the discussions of Ctrl-C and critical-error
    exception handlers in Chapters 5 and 8.

Chapter 14  Installable Device Drivers

    Device drivers are the modules of an operating system that control the
    hardware. They isolate the operating-system kernel from the specific
    characteristics and idiosyncrasies of the peripheral devices interfaced to
    the central processor. Thus, the driver's relationship to the kernel is
    analogous to the operating system's relationship to application programs.

    The installable device drivers that were introduced in MS-DOS version 2
    give the user great flexibility. They allow the user to customize and
    configure the computer for a wide range of peripheral devices, with a
    minimum of troublesome interactions and without having to "patch" the
    operating system. Even the most inexperienced user can install a new
    device into a system by plugging in a card, copying a driver file to the
    boot disk, and editing the system configuration file.

    For those inclined to do their own programming, the MS-DOS installable
    device drivers are interfaced to the hardware-independent kernel through a
    simple and clearly defined scheme of function codes and data structures.
    Given adequate information about the hardware, any competent assembly-
    language programmer can expect to successfully interface even the most
    bizarre device to MS-DOS without altering the operating system in the
    slightest and without acquiring any special or proprietary knowledge about
    its innards.

    In retrospect, installable device drivers have proven to be one of the key
    usability features of MS-DOS. I feel that they have been largely
    responsible for the rapid proliferation and competitive pricing of
    high-speed mass-storage devices for MS-DOS machines, and for the growing
    confidence of the average user toward "tampering with" (upgrading) his or
    her machine.


MS-DOS Device-Driver Types

    Drivers written for MS-DOS fall into two distinct classes:

    ■  Block-device drivers

    ■  Character-device drivers

    A driver's class determines what functions it must support, how it is
    viewed by MS-DOS, and how it makes the associated physical device appear
    to behave when an application program makes a request for I/O.

Character-Device Drivers

    Character-device drivers control peripheral devices that perform input and
    output one character (or byte) at a time, such as a terminal or printer. A
    single character-device driver ordinarily supports a single hardware unit.
    Each character device has a one-to-eight-character logical name, and an
    application program can use this name to open the device for input or
    output, as though it were a file. The logical name is strictly a means of
    identification for MS-DOS and has no physical equivalent on the device.

    MS-DOS's built-in character-device drivers for the console, serial port,
    and printer are unique in that an application program can access them in
    three different ways:

    ■  It can open them by name (CON, AUX, PRN, etc.) for input and output,
        like any other character device.

    ■  It can use the special-purpose MS-DOS function calls (Int 21H Functions
        01-0CH).

    ■  It can use the default handles (standard input, standard output,
        standard error, standard auxiliary, and standard printer), which do not
        need to be opened to be used.

    The number of additional character-device drivers that can be installed is
    limited only by available memory and by the requirement that each driver
    have a unique logical name. If more than one driver uses the same logical
    name, the last driver to be loaded will supersede any others and will
    receive all I/O requests addressed to that logical name. This fact can
    occasionally be turned to advantage; for example, it allows the user to
    replace the system's default CON driver, which does not support cursor
    positioning or character attributes, with the more powerful ANSI.SYS
    driver.

    ASCII vs Binary Mode

    MS-DOS regards a handle associated with a character device to be in either
    ASCII (cooked) mode or binary (raw) mode. The mode affects MS-DOS's
    buffering of data for read and write requests. The driver itself is not
    aware of the mode, and the mode does not affect its operation. An
    application can select the mode of a handle with the IOCTL function (Int
    21H Function 44H).

    During ASCII-mode input, MS-DOS requests characters one at a time from the
    driver and places them into its own internal buffer, echoing each to the
    screen (if the input device is the keyboard) and checking each character
    for a Ctrl-C (03H). When the number of characters requested by the
    application program has been received, when a Ctrl-Z is detected, or when
    the Enter key is pressed (in the case of the keyboard), MS-DOS terminates
    the input and copies the data from its internal buffer into the requesting
    program's buffer. Similarly, during ASCII-mode output, MS-DOS passes the
    characters to the device driver one at a time and checks for a Ctrl-C
    pending at the keyboard between each character. When a Ctrl-C is detected,
    MS-DOS aborts the input or output operation and transfers to the routine
    whose address is stored in the Int 23H vector.

    In binary mode, MS-DOS reads or writes the exact number of bytes requested
    by the application program, without regard to any control characters such
    as Enter or Ctrl-C. MS-DOS passes the entire request through to the driver
    in a single operation, instead of breaking it into single-character reads
    or writes, and transfers the characters directly to or from the requesting
    program's buffer.

Block-Device drivers

    Block-device drivers usually control random-access mass-storage devices
    such as floppy-disk drives and fixed disks, although they can also be used
    to control non-random-access devices such as magnetic-tape drives. Block
    devices transfer data in chunks, rather than one byte at a time. The size
    of the blocks may be either fixed (disk drives) or variable (tape drives).

    A block driver can support more than one hardware unit, map a single
    physical unit onto two or more logical units, or both. Block devices do
    not have file-like logical names, as character devices do. Instead, MS-DOS
    assigns drive designators to the block-device units or logical drives in
    an alphabetic sequence: A, B, and so forth. Each logical drive contains a
    file system: boot block, file allocation table, root directory, and so
    forth. (See Chapter 10.)

    A block-device driver's position in the chain of all drivers determines
    the first letter assigned to that driver. The number of logical drive
    units that the driver supports determines the total number of letters
    assigned to it.

    Block-device drivers always read or write exactly the number of sectors
    requested (barring hardware or addressing errors) and never filter or
    otherwise manipulate the contents of the blocks being transferred.


Structure of an MS-DOS Device Driver

    A device driver consists of three major parts (Figure 14-1):

    ■  A device header

    ■  A strategy (strat) routine

    ■  An interrupt (intr) routine

    We'll discuss each of these in more detail as we work through this
    chapter.

The Device Header

    The device header (Figure 14-2) lies at the beginning of the driver. It
    contains a link to the next driver in the chain, a set of attribute flags
    for the device (Figure 14-3), offsets to the executable strategy and
    interrupt routines for the device, and the logical-device name (if it is a
    character device such as PRN or COM1) or the number of logical units (if
    it is a block device).

    Figure 14-3.  Device attribute word in device header. In block-device
    drivers, only bits 6, 11, and 13─15 (and bit 1 in MS-DOS version 4.0) have
    significance; the remainder should always be zero.

The Strategy Routine

    MS-DOS calls the strategy routine (strat) for the device when the driver
    is first loaded and installed, and again whenever an application program
    issues an I/O request for the device. MS-DOS passes the strategy routine a
    double-word pointer to a data structure called a request header. This
    structure contains information about the type of operation to be
    performed. In current versions of MS-DOS, the strategy routine never
    actually performs any I/O operation but simply saves the pointer to the
    request header. The strat routine must not make any Int 21H function
    calls.

    The first 13 bytes of the request header are the same for all
    device-driver functions and are therefore referred to as the static
    portion of the header. The number and contents of the subsequent bytes
    vary according to the type of function being requested (Figure 14-4).
    Both MS-DOS and the driver read and write information in the request
    header.

    The request header's most important component is a command code, or
    function number, passed in its third byte to select a driver subfunction
    such as read, write, or status. Other information passed to the driver in
    the header includes unit numbers, transfer addresses, and sector or byte
    counts.

    to all driver functions; the number and definition of the subsequent bytes
    vary, depending upon the function type. The structure shown here is the
    one used by the read and write subfunctions of the driver.

The Interrupt Routine

    The last and most complex part of a device driver is the interrupt routine
    (intr), which MS-DOS calls immediately after it calls the strategy
    routine. The interrupt routine implements the device driver proper; it
    performs (or calls other resident routines to perform) the actual input or
    output operations, based on the information passed in the request header.
    The strat routine may not make any Int 21H function calls, except for a
    restricted set during driver initialization.

    When an I/O function is completed, the interrupt routine uses the status
    field in the request header to inform the DOS kernel about the outcome of
    the requested I/O operation. It can use other fields in the request header
    to pass back such useful information as counts of the actual sectors or
    bytes transferred.

    The interrupt routine usually consists of the following elements:

    ■  A collection of subroutines to implement the various function types
        that may be requested by MS-DOS (sometimes called the command-code
        routines)

    ■  A centralized entry point that saves all affected registers, extracts
        the desired function code from the request header, and branches to the
        appropriate command-code routine (typically accomplished with a jump
        table)

    ■  A centralized exit point that stores status and error codes into the
        request header (Figures 14-5 and 14-6) and restores the previous
        contents of the affected registers

    The command-code routines that implement the various functions supported
    by an installable device driver are discussed in detail in the following
    pages.

    return status word of the request header.

    Although its name suggests otherwise, the interrupt routine is never
    entered asynchronously (on an I/O completion interrupt, for example).
    Thus, the division of function between strategy and interrupt routines is
    completely artificial in the current versions of MS-DOS.


The Command-Code Routines

    A total of 20 command codes are defined for MS-DOS device drivers. The
    command codes (which are not consecutive), the names of the associated
    driver-interrupt routines, and the MS-DOS versions in which they are first
    supported are as follows:

    As you can see from the preceding table, a driver's interrupt section must
    support functions 0 through 12 under all versions of MS-DOS. Drivers
    tailored for MS-DOS 3.0 and 3.1 can optionally support an additional four
    functions, and MS-DOS drivers for versions 3.2 and later can support three
    more (for a total of 20). MS-DOS inspects the bits in the attribute word
    of the device-driver header to determine which of the optional functions a
    driver supports, if any.

    Some of the functions are relevant only for character-device drivers and
    some only for block-device drivers; a few have meaning to both types. In
    any case, both driver types should have an executable routine present for
    each function, even if it does nothing except set the done flag in the
    status word of the request header.

    In the command-code descriptions that follow, RH refers to the request
    header whose address was passed to the strategy routine in ES:BX, BYTE is
    an 8-bit parameter, WORD is a 16-bit parameter, and DWORD is a far pointer
    (a 16-bit offset followed by a 16-bit segment).

Function 00H (0): Driver Initialization

    MS-DOS requests the driver's initialization function (init) only once,
    when the driver is first loaded. This function performs any necessary
    device hardware initialization, setup of interrupt vectors, and so forth.
    The initialization routine must return the address of the position where
    free memory begins after the driver code (the break address), so that
    MS-DOS knows where it can build certain control structures and then load
    the next installable driver. If this is a block-device driver, init must
    also return the number of units and the address of a BPB pointer array.

    MS-DOS uses the number of units returned by a block driver in the request
    header to assign drive identifiers. For example, if the current maximum
    drive is D and the driver being initialized supports four units, MS-DOS
    will assign it the drive letters E, F, G, and H. Although the
    device-driver header also has a field for number of units, MS-DOS does not
    inspect it.

    The BPB pointer array is an array of word offsets to BIOS parameter blocks
    (Figure 14-7). Each unit defined by the driver must have one entry in the
    array, although the entries can all point to the same BPB to conserve
    memory. During the operating-system boot sequence, MS-DOS scans all the
    BPBs defined by all the units in all the block-device drivers to determine
    the largest sector size that exists on any device in the system and uses
    this information to set its cache buffer size.

    The operating-system services that the initialization code can invoke at
    load time are very limited only Int 21H Functions 01H through 0CH and
    30H. These are just adequate to check the MS-DOS version number and
    display a driver-identification or error message.

    Many programmers position the initialization code at the end of the driver
    and return that address as the location of the first free memory, so that
    MS-DOS will reclaim the memory occupied by the initialization routine
    after the routine is finished with its work. If the initialization routine
    finds that the device is missing or defective and wants to abort the
    installation of the driver completely so that it does not occupy any
    memory, it should return number of units as zero and set the free memory
    address to CS:0000H. (A character-device driver that wants to abort its
    installation should clear bit 15 of the attribute word in the driver
    header and then set the units field and free memory address as though it
    were a block-device driver.)

Function 01H (1): Media Check

    The media-check function applies only to block devices, and in
    character-device drivers it should do nothing except set the done flag.
    This function is called when a drive-access call other than a simple file
    read or write is pending. MS-DOS passes to the function the media
    descriptor byte for the disk that it assumes is in the drive (Figure
    14-8). If feasible, the media-check routine returns a code indicating
    whether the disk has been changed since the last transfer. If the
    media-check routine can assert that the disk has not been changed, MS-DOS
    can bypass rereading the FAT before a directory access, which improves
    overall performance.

    Figure 14-8.  Current valid MS-DOS codes for the media descriptor byte of
    the request header, assuming bit 13 in the attribute word of the driver
    header is zero.

    MS-DOS responds to the results of the media-check function in the
    following ways:

    ■  If the disk has not been changed, MS-DOS proceeds with the disk access.

    ■  If the disk has been changed, MS-DOS invalidates all buffers associated
        with this unit, including buffers containing data waiting to be written
        (this data is simply lost), performs a BUILD BPB call, and then reads
        the disk's FAT and directory.

    ■  If the disk-change status is unknown, the action taken by MS-DOS
        depends upon the state of its internal buffers. If data that needs to
        be written out is present in the buffers, MS-DOS assumes no disk change
        has occurred and writes the data (taking the risk that, if the disk
        really was changed, the file structure on the new disk may be damaged).
        If the buffers are empty or have all been previously flushed to the
        disk, MS-DOS assumes that the disk was changed, and then proceeds as
        described above for the disk-changed return code.

    If bit 11 of the device-header attribute word is set (that is, the driver
    supports the optional open/close/removable-media functions), the host
    system is MS-DOS version 3.0 or later, and the function returns the
    disk-changed code (-1), the function must also return the segment and
    offset of the ASCIIZ volume label for the previous disk in the drive. (If
    the driver does not have the volume label, it can return a pointer to the
    ASCIIZ string NO NAME.) If MS-DOS determines that the disk was changed
    with unwritten data still present in its buffers, it issues a
    critical-error 0FH (invalid disk change). Application programs can trap
    this critical error and prompt the user to replace the original disk.

    The media-check function is called with

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    RH + 1             BYTE              Unit code

    RH + 2             BYTE              Command code = 1

    RH + 13            BYTE              Media descriptor byte
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    It returns

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    RH + 3             WORD              Status

    RH + 14            BYTE              Media-change code:

                                        -1 if disk changed

                                        0 if don't know whether disk changed

                                        1 if disk not changed

    RH + 15            DWORD             Pointer to previous volume label, if
                                        device attribute bit 11 = 1 and disk
                                        has been changed (MS-DOS versions 3.0
                                        and later)
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Function 02H (2): Build BIOS Parameter Block (BPB)

    The build BPB function applies only to block devices, and in
    character-device drivers should do nothing except set the done flag. The
    kernel uses this function to get a pointer to the valid BPB (see Figure
    14-7) for the current disk and calls it when the disk-changed code is
    returned by the media-check routine or the don't-know code is returned and
    there are no dirty buffers (buffers with changed data that have not yet
    been written to disk). Thus, a call to this function indicates that the
    disk has been legally changed.

    The build BPB function receives a pointer to a one-sector buffer in the
    request header. If bit 13 in the driver header's attribute word is zero,
    the buffer contains the first sector of the FAT (which includes the media
    identification byte) and should not be altered by the driver. If bit 13 is
    set, the driver can use the buffer as scratch space.

    The build BPB function is called with

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    RH + 1             BYTE              Unit code

    RH + 2             BYTE              Command code = 2

    RH + 13            BYTE              Media descriptor byte

    RH + 14            DWORD             Buffer address
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    It returns

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    RH + 3             WORD              Status

    RH + 18            DWORD             Pointer to new BPB
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Under MS-DOS versions 3.0 and later, if bit 11 of the header's device
    attribute word is set, this routine should also read the volume label off
    the disk and save it.

Function 03H (3): I/O-Control Read

    The IOCTL read function allows the device driver to pass information
    directly to the application program. This function is called only if bit
    14 is set in the device attribute word. MS-DOS performs no error check on
    IOCTL I/O calls.

    The IOCTL read function is called with

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    RH + 1             BYTE              Unit code (block devices)

    RH + 2             BYTE              Command code = 3

    RH + 13            BYTE              Media descriptor byte

    RH + 14            DWORD             Transfer address

    RH + 18            WORD              Byte/sector count

    RH + 20            WORD              Starting sector number (block
                                        devices)
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    It returns

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    RH + 3             WORD              Status

    RH + 18            WORD              Actual bytes or sectors transferred
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Function 04H (4): Read

    The read function transfers data from the device into the specified memory
    buffer. If an error is encountered during the read, the function must set
    the error status and, in addition, report the number of bytes or sectors
    successfully transferred; it is not sufficient to simply report an error.

    The read function is called with

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    RH + 1             BYTE              Unit code (block devices)

    RH + 2             BYTE              Command code = 4

    RH + 13            BYTE              Media descriptor byte

    RH + 14            DWORD             Transfer address

    RH + 18            WORD              Byte/sector count

    RH + 20            WORD              Starting sector number (block
                                        devices)
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    For block-device read operations in MS-DOS version 4, if the logical unit
    is larger than 32 MB and bit 1 of the driver's attribute word is set, the
    following request structure is used instead:

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    RH + 1             BYTE              Unit code

    RH + 2             BYTE              Command code = 4

    RH + 13            BYTE              Media descriptor byte

    RH + 14            DWORD             Transfer address

    RH + 18            WORD              Sector count

    RH + 20            WORD              Contains -1 to signal use of 32-bit
                                        sector number

    RH + 26            DWORD             32-bit starting sector number
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    The read function returns

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    RH + 3             WORD              Status

    RH + 18            WORD              Actual bytes or sectors transferred

    RH + 22            DWORD             Pointer to volume label if error 0FH
                                        is returned (MS-DOS versions 3.0 and
                                        later)
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Under MS-DOS versions 3.0 and later, this routine can use the count of
    open files maintained by the open and close functions (0DH and 0EH) and
    the media descriptor byte to determine whether the disk has been illegally
    changed.

Function 05H (5): Nondestructive Read

    The nondestructive read function applies only to character devices, and in
    block devices it should do nothing except set the done flag. It returns
    the next character that would be obtained with a read function (command
    code 4), without removing that character from the driver's internal
    buffer. MS-DOS uses this function to check the console driver for pending
    Control-C characters during other operations.

    The nondestructive read function is called with

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    RH + 2             BYTE              Command code = 5
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    It returns

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    RH + 3             WORD              Status

                                        If busy bit = 0, at least one
                                        character is waiting

                                        If busy bit = 1, no characters are
                                        waiting

    RH + 13            BYTE              Character (if busy bit = 0)
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Function 06H (6): Input Status

    The input-status function applies only to character devices, and in
    block-device drivers it should do nothing except set the done flag. This
    function returns the current input status for the device, allowing MS-DOS
    to test whether characters are waiting in a type-ahead buffer. If the
    character device does not have a type-ahead buffer, the input-status
    routine should always return the busy bit equal to zero, so that MS-DOS
    will not wait forever to call the read (04H) or nondestructive read (05H)
    function.

    The input-status function is called with

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    RH + 2             BYTE              Command code = 6
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    It returns

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    RH + 3             WORD              Status:

                                        If busy bit = 1, read request goes to
                                        physical device.

                                        If busy bit = 0, characters already
                                        in device buffer and read request
                                        returns quickly.
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Function 07H (7): Flush Input Buffers

    The flush-input-buffers function applies only to character devices, and in
    block-device drivers it should do nothing except set the done flag. This
    function causes any data waiting in the input buffer to be discarded.

    The flush-input-buffers function is called with

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    RH + 2             BYTE              Command code = 7
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    It returns

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    RH + 3             WORD              Status

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Function 08H (8): Write

    The write function transfers data from the specified memory buffer to the
    device. If an error is encountered during the write, the write function
    must set the error status and, in addition, report the number of bytes or
    sectors successfully transferred; it is not sufficient to simply report an
    error.

    The write function is called with

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    RH + 1             BYTE              Unit code (block devices)

    RH + 2             BYTE              Command code = 8

    RH + 13            BYTE              Media descriptor byte

    RH + 14            DWORD             Transfer address

    RH + 18            WORD              Byte/sector count

    RH + 20            WORD              Starting sector number (block
                                        devices)
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    For block-device write operations in MS-DOS version 4, if the logical unit
    is larger than 32 MB and bit 1 of the driver's attribute word is set, the
    following request structure is used instead:

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    RH + 1             BYTE              Unit code

    RH + 2             BYTE              Command code = 8

    RH + 13            BYTE              Media descriptor byte

    RH + 14            DWORD             Transfer address

    RH + 18            WORD              Sector count

    RH + 20            WORD              Contains -1 to signal use of 32-bit
                                        sector number

    RH + 26            DWORD             32-bit starting sector number
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    The write function returns

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    RH + 3             WORD              Status

    RH + 18            WORD              Actual bytes or sectors transferred

    RH + 22            DWORD             Pointer to volume label if error 0FH
                                        returned (MS-DOS versions 3.0 and
                                        later)
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Under MS-DOS versions 3.0 and later, this routine can use the reference
    count of open files maintained by the open and close functions (0DH and
    0EH) and the media descriptor byte to determine whether the disk has been
    illegally changed.

Function 09H (9): Write with Verify

    The write-with-verify function transfers data from the specified memory
    buffer to the device. If feasible, it should perform a read-after-write
    verification of the data to confirm that the data was written correctly.
    Otherwise, Function 09H is exactly like Function 08H.

Function 0AH (10): Output Status

    The output-status function applies only to character devices, and in
    block-device drivers it should do nothing except set the done flag. This
    function returns the current output status for the device.

    The output-status function is called with

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    RH + 2             BYTE              Command code = 10 (0AH)
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    It returns

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    RH + 3             WORD              Status:

                                        If busy bit = 1, write request waits
                                        for completion of current request.

                                        If busy bit = 0, device idle and
                                        write request starts immediately.
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Function 0BH (11): Flush Output Buffers

    The flush-output-buffers function applies only to character devices, and
    in block-device drivers it should do nothing except set the done flag.
    This function empties the output buffer, if any, and discards any pending
    output requests.

    The flush-output-buffers function is called with

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    RH + 2             BYTE              Command code = 11 (0BH)
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    It returns

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    RH + 3             WORD              Status

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Function 0CH (12): I/O-Control Write

    The IOCTL write function allows an application program to pass control
    information directly to the driver. This function is called only if bit 14
    is set in the device attribute word. MS-DOS performs no error check on
    IOCTL I/O calls.

    The IOCTL write function is called with

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    RH + 1             BYTE              Unit code (block devices)

    RH + 2             BYTE              Command code = 12 (0CH)

    RH + 13            BYTE              Media descriptor byte

    RH + 14            DWORD             Transfer address

    RH + 18            WORD              Byte/sector count

    RH + 20            WORD              Starting sector number (block
                                        devices)
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    It returns

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    RH + 3             WORD              Status

    RH + 18            WORD              Actual bytes or sectors transferred
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Function 0DH (13): Device Open

    The device-open function is supported only under MS-DOS versions 3.0 and
    later and is called only if bit 11 is set in the device attribute word of
    the device header.

    On block devices, the device-open function can be used to manage local
    buffering and to increment a reference count of the number of open files
    on the device. This capability must be used with care, however, because
    programs that access files through FCBs frequently fail to close them,
    thus invalidating the open-files count. One way to protect against this
    possibility is to reset the open-files count to zero, without flushing the
    buffers, whenever the answer to a media-change call is yes and a
    subsequent build BPB call is made to the driver.

    On character devices, the device-open function can be used to send a
    device-initialization string (which can be set into the driver by an
    application program by means of an IOCTL write function) or to deny
    simultaneous access to a character device by more than one process. Note
    that the predefined handles for the CON, AUX, and PRN devices are always
    open.

    The device-open function is called with

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    RH + 1             BYTE              Unit code (block devices)

    RH + 2             BYTE              Command code = 13 (0DH)
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    It returns

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    RH + 3             WORD              Status
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Function 0EH (14): Device Close

    The device-close function is supported only under MS-DOS versions 3.0 and
    later and is called only if bit 11 is set in the device attribute word of
    the device header.

    On block devices, this function can be used to manage local buffering and
    to decrement a reference count of the number of open files on the device;
    when the count reaches zero, all files have been closed and the driver
    should flush buffers because the user may change disks.

    On character devices, the device-close function can be used to send a
    device-dependent post-I/O string such as a formfeed. (This string can be
    set into the driver by an application program by means of an IOCTL write

    devices are never closed.

    The device-close function is called with

    RH + 2             BYTE              Command code = 14 (0EH)
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Function 0FH (15): Removable Media

    The removable-media function is supported only under MS-DOS versions 3.0
    and later and only on block devices; in character-device drivers it should
    do nothing except set the done flag. This function is called only if bit
    11 is set in the device attribute word in the device header.

    The removable-media function is called with

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    It returns

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    RH + 3             WORD              Status:

                                        If busy bit = 1, medium nonremovable

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Function 10H (16): Output Until Busy

    The output-until-busy function is supported only under MS-DOS versions 3.0
    and later, and only on character devices; in block-device drivers it
    should do nothing except set the done flag. This function transfers data
    from the specified memory buffer to a device, continuing to transfer bytes
    until the device is busy. It is called only if bit 13 of the device
    attribute word is set in the device header.

    This function is an optimization included specifically for the use of
    print spoolers. It is not an error for this function to return a number of
    bytes transferred that is less than the number of bytes requested.

    The output-until-busy function is called with

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    RH + 2             BYTE              Command code = 16 (10H)

    RH + 14            DWORD             Transfer address

    RH + 18            WORD              Byte count
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    It returns

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    RH + 3             WORD              Status

    RH + 18            WORD              Actual bytes transferred
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Function 13H (19) Generic IOCTL

    The generic IOCTL function is supported only under MS-DOS versions 3.2 and
    later and is called only if bit 6 is set in the device attribute word of
    the device header. This function corresponds to the MS-DOS generic IOCTL
    service supplied to application programs by Int 21H Function 44H
    Subfunctions 0CH and 0DH.

    The generic IOCTL function is passed a category (major) code, a function
    (minor) code, the contents of the SI and DI registers at the point of the
    IOCTL call, and the segment and offset of a data buffer. This buffer in
    turn contains other information whose format depends on the major and
    minor IOCTL codes passed in the request header. The driver must interpret
    the major and minor codes in the request header and the contents of the
    additional buffer to determine which operation it will carry out, then set
    the done flag in the request-header status word, and return any other
    applicable information in the request header or the data buffer.

    Services that the generic IOCTL function may invoke, if the driver
    supports them, include configuration of the driver for nonstandard disk
    formats, reading and writing entire disk tracks of data, and formatting
    and verifying tracks. The generic IOCTL function has been designed to be
    open-ended, so that it can be used to easily extend the device-driver
    definition under future versions of MS-DOS.

    The generic IOCTL function is called with

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    RH + 1             BYTE              Unit number (block devices)

    RH + 2             BYTE              Command code = 19 (13H)

    RH + 13            BYTE              Category (major) code

    RH + 14            BYTE              Function (minor) code

    RH + 15            WORD              SI register contents

    RH + 17            WORD              DI register contents

    RH + 19            DWORD             Address of generic IOCTL data packet
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    It returns

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    RH + 3             WORD              Status
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Function 17H (23): Get Logical Device

    The get-logical-device function is supported only under MS-DOS versions
    3.2 and later and only on block devices; in character-device drivers it
    should do nothing except set the done bit in the status word. This
    function is called only if bit 6 is set in the device attribute word of
    the device header. It corresponds to the get-logical-device-map service
    supplied to application programs through Int 21H Function 44H Subfunction
    0EH.

    The get-logical-device function returns a code for the last drive letter
    used to reference the device; if only one drive letter is assigned to the
    device, the returned unit code should be zero. Thus, this function can be
    used to determine whether more than one drive letter is assigned to the
    same physical device.

    The get-logical-device function is called with

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    RH + 1             BYTE              Unit code

    RH + 2             BYTE              Command code = 23 (17H)
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    It returns

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    RH + 1             BYTE              Last unit referenced, or zero

    RH + 3             WORD              Status
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Function 18H (24): Set Logical Device

    The set-logical-device function is supported only under MS-DOS versions
    3.2 and later and only on block devices; in character-device drivers it
    should do nothing except set the done bit in the status word. This
    function is called only if bit 6 is set in the device attribute word of
    the device header. It corresponds to the set-logical-device-map service
    supplied to application programs by MS-DOS through Int 21H Function 44H
    Subfunction 0FH.

    The set-logical-device function informs the driver of the next
    logical-drive identifier that will be used to reference the physical
    device. The unit code passed by the MS-DOS kernel in this case is
    zero-based relative to the number of logical drives supported by this
    particular driver. For example, if the driver supports two floppy-disk
    units (A and B), only one physical floppy-disk drive exists in the system,
    and the set-logical-device function is called with a unit number of 1, the
    driver is being informed that the next read or write request from the
    kernel will be directed to drive B.

    The set-logical-device function is called with

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    RH + 1             BYTE              Unit code

    RH + 2             BYTE              Command code = 24 (18H)
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    It returns

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    RH + 3             WORD              Status
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


The Processing of a Typical I/O Request

    An application program requests an I/O operation from MS-DOS by loading
    registers with the appropriate values and executing an Int 21H. This
    results in the following sequence of actions:

    1.  MS-DOS inspects its internal tables and determines which device driver
        should receive the I/O request.

    2.  MS-DOS creates a request-header data packet in a reserved area of
        memory. (Disk I/O requests are transformed from file and record
        information into logical-sector requests by MS-DOS's interpretation of
        the disk directory and FAT.)

    3.  MS-DOS calls the device driver's strat entry point, passing the
        address of the request header in the ES:BX registers.

    4.  The device driver saves the address of the request header in a local
        variable and performs a FAR RETURN.

    5.  MS-DOS calls the device driver's intr entry point.

    6.  The interrupt routine saves all registers, retrieves the address of
        the request header that was saved by the strategy routine, extracts
        the function code, and branches to the appropriate command-code
        subroutine to perform the function.

    7.  If a data transfer on a block device was requested, the driver's read
        or write subroutine translates the logical-sector number into a head,
        track, and physical-sector address for the requested unit and then
        performs the I/O operation. Because a multiple-sector transfer can be
        requested in a single request header, a single request by MS-DOS to
        the driver can result in multiple read or write commands to the disk
        controller.

    8.  When the requested function is complete, the interrupt routine sets
        the status word and any other required information into the request
        header, restores all registers to their state at entry, and performs a
        FAR RETURN.

    9.  MS-DOS translates the driver's return status into the appropriate
        return code and carry-flag status for the MS-DOS Int 21H function that
        was requested and returns control to the application program.

    Note that a single request by an application program can result in MS-DOS
    passing many request headers to the driver. For example, attempting to
    open a file in a subdirectory on a previously unaccessed disk drive might
    require the following actions:

    ■  Reading the disk's boot sector to get the BPB

    ■  Reading from one to many sectors of the root directory to find the
        entry for the subdirectory and obtain its starting-cluster number

    ■  Reading from one to many sectors of both the FAT and the subdirectory
        itself to find the entry for the desired file


The CLOCK Driver: A Special Case

    MS-DOS uses the CLOCK device for marking file control blocks and directory
    entries with the date and time, as well as for providing the date and time
    services to application programs. This device has a unique type of
    interaction with MS-DOS──a 6-byte sequence is read from or written to the
    driver that obtains or sets the current date and time. The sequence has
    the following format:

    ┌─────────┬─────────┬─────────┬─────────┬─────────┬─────────┐
    │    0    │    1    │    2    │    3    │   4     │    5    │
    │  Days   │  Days   │ Minutes │  Hours  │Seconds/ │ Seconds │
    │low byte │high byte│         │         │  100    │         │
    └─────────┴─────────┴─────────┴─────────┴─────────┴─────────┘

    The value passed for days is a 16-bit integer representing the number of
    days elapsed since January 1, 1980.

    The clock driver can have any logical-device name because MS-DOS uses the
    CLOCK bit in the device attribute word of the driver's device header to
    identify the device, rather than its name. On IBM PC systems, the clock
    device has the logical-device name CLOCK$.


Writing and Installing a Device Driver

    Now that we have discussed the structure and capabilities of installable
    device drivers for the MS-DOS environment, we can discuss the mechanical
    steps of assembling and linking them.

Assembly

    Device drivers for MS-DOS always have an origin of zero but are otherwise
    assembled, linked, and converted into an executable module as though they
    were .COM files. (Although MS-DOS is also capable of loading installable
    drivers in the .EXE file format, this introduces unnecessary complexity
    into writing and debugging drivers and offers no significant advantages.
    In addition, it is not possible to use .EXE-format drivers with some IBM
    versions of MS-DOS because the .EXE loader is located in COMMAND.COM,
    which is not present when the installable device drivers are being
    loaded.) The driver should not have a declared stack segment and must, in
    general, follow the other restrictions outlined in Chapter 3 for
    memory-image (.COM) programs. A driver can be loaded anywhere, so beware
    that you do not make any assumptions in your code about the driver's
    location in physical memory. Figure 14-9 presents a skeleton example that
    you can follow as you read the next few pages.

    Figure 14-9.  DRIVER.ASM: A functional skeleton from which you can
    implement your own working device driver.

    The driver's device header must be located at the beginning of the file
    (offset 0000H). Both words in the link field in the header should be set
    to -1. The attribute word must be set up correctly for the device type and
    other options. The offsets to the strategy and interrupt routines must be
    relative to the same segment base as the device header itself. If the
    driver is for a character device, the name field should be filled in
    properly with the device's logical name. The logical name can be any legal
    8-character filename, padded with spaces and without a colon. Beware of
    accidentally duplicating the names of existing character devices, unless
    you are intentionally superseding a resident driver.

    MS-DOS calls the strategy and interrupt routines for the device by means
    of an intersegment call (CALL FAR) when the driver is first loaded and
    installed and again whenever an application program issues an I/O request
    for the device. MS-DOS uses the ES:BX registers to pass the strat routine
    a double-word pointer to the request header; this address should be saved
    internally in the driver so that it is available for use during the
    subsequent call to the intr routine.

    The command-code routines for function codes 0 through 12 (0CH) must be
    present in every installable device driver, regardless of device type.
    Functions 13 (0DH) and above are optional for drivers used with MS-DOS
    versions 3.0 and later and can be handled in one of the following ways:

    ■  Don't implement them, and leave the associated bits in the device
        header cleared. The resulting driver will work in either version 2 or
        version 3 but does not take full advantage of the augmented
        functionality of version 3.

    ■  Implement them, and test the MS-DOS version during the initialization
        sequence, setting bits 6 and 11 of the device header appropriately.
        Write all command-code routines so that they test this bit and adjust
        to accommodate the host version of MS-DOS. Such a driver requires more
        work and testing but will take full advantage of both the version 2 and
        the version 3 environments.

    ■  Implement them, and assume that all the version 3 facilities are
        available. With this approach, the resulting driver may not work
        properly under version 2.

    Remember that device drivers must preserve the integrity of MS-DOS. The
    driver must preserve all registers, including flags (especially the
    direction flag and interrupt enable bits), and if the driver makes heavy
    use of the stack, it should switch to an internal stack of adequate depth
    (the MS-DOS stack has room for only 40 to 50 bytes when a driver is
    called).

    If you install a new CON driver, be sure to set the bits for standard
    input and standard output in the device attribute word in the device
    header.

    You'll recall that one file can contain multiple drivers. In this case,
    the device-header link field of each driver should point to the segment
    offset of the next, all using the same segment base, and the link field
    for the last driver in the file should be set to -1,-1. The initialization
    routines for all the drivers in the file should return the same break
    address.

Linking

    Use the standard MS-DOS linker to transform the .OBJ file that is output
    from the assembler into a relocatable .EXE module. Then, use the EXE2BIN
    utility (see Chapter 4) to convert the .EXE file into a memory-image
    program. The extension on the final driver file can be anything, but .BIN
    and .SYS are most commonly used in MS-DOS systems, and it is therefore
    wise to follow one of these conventions.

Installation

    After the driver is assembled, linked, and converted to a .BIN or .SYS
    file, copy it to the root directory of a bootable disk. If it is a
    character-device driver, do not use the same name for the file as you used
    for the logical device listed in the driver's header, or you will not be
    able to delete, copy, or rename the file after the driver is loaded.

    Use your favorite text editor to add the line

    DEVICE=[D:][PATH]FILENAME.EXT

    to the CONFIG.SYS file on the bootable disk. (In this line, D: is an
    optional drive designator and FILENAME.EXT is the name of the file
    containing your new device driver. You can include a path specification in
    the entry if you prefer not to put the driver file in your root
    directory.) Now restart your computer system to load the modified
    CONFIG.SYS file.

    During the MS-DOS boot sequence, the SYSINIT module (which is part of
    IO.SYS) reads and processes the CONFIG.SYS file. It loads the driver into
    memory and inspects the device header. If the driver is a character-device
    driver, SYSINIT links it into the device chain ahead of the other
    character devices; if it is a block-device driver, SYSINIT places it
    behind all previously linked block devices and the resident block devices
    (Figures 14-10, 14-11, and 14-12). It accomplishes the linkage by
    updating the link field in the device header to point to the segment and
    offset of the next driver in the chain. The link field of the last driver
    in the chain contains -1,-1.

    Next, SYSINIT calls the strat routine with a request header that contains
    a command code of zero, and then it calls the intr routine. The driver
    executes its initialization routine and returns the break address, telling
    MS-DOS how much memory to reserve for this driver. Now MS-DOS can proceed
    to the next entry in the CONFIG.SYS file.

    You cannot supersede a built-in block-device driver──you can only add
    supplemental block devices. However, you can override the default system
    driver for a character device (such as CON) with an installed driver by
    giving it the same logical-device name in the device header. When
    processing a character I/O request, MS-DOS always scans the list of
    installed drivers before it scans the list of default devices and takes
    the first match.

Debugging a Device Driver

    The most important thing to remember when testing new device drivers is to
    maintain adequate backups and a viable fallback position. Don't modify the
    CONFIG.SYS file and install the new driver on your fixed disk before it is
    proven! Be prudent──create a bootable floppy disk and put the modified
    CONFIG.SYS file and the new driver on that for debugging. When everything
    is working properly, copy the finished product to its permanent storage
    medium.

    The easiest way to test a new device driver is to write a simple
    assembly-language front-end routine that sets up a simulated request
    packet and then performs FAR CALLs to the strat and intr entry points,
    exactly as MS-DOS would. You can then link the driver and the front end
    together into a .COM or .EXE file that can be run under the control of
    CodeView or another debugger. This arrangement makes it easy to trace each
    of the command-code routines individually, to observe the results of the
    I/O, and to examine the status codes returned in the request header.

    Tracing the installed driver when it is linked into the MS-DOS system in
    the normal manner is more difficult. Breakpoints must be chosen carefully,
    to yield the maximum possible information per debugging run. Because
    current versions of MS-DOS maintain only one request header internally,
    the request header that was being used by the driver you are tracing will
    be overwritten as soon as your debugger makes an output request to display
    information. You will find it helpful to add a routine to your
    initialization subroutine that displays the driver's load address on the
    console when you boot MS-DOS; you can then use this address to inspect the
    device-driver header and set breakpoints within the body of the driver.

    Debugging a device driver can also be somewhat sticky when interrupt
    handling is involved, especially if the device uses the same
    interrupt-request priority level (IRQ level) as other peripherals in the
    system. Cautious, conservative programming is needed to avoid unexpected
    and unreproducible interactions with other device drivers and interrupt
    handlers. If possible, prove out the basic logic of the driver using
    polled I/O, rather than interrupt-driven I/O, and introduce interrupt
    handling only when you know the rest of the driver's logic to be solid.

    Typical device-driver errors or problems that can cause system crashes or
    strange system behavior include the following:

    ■  Failure to set the linkage address of the last driver in a file to -1

    ■  Overflow of the MS-DOS stack by driver-initialization code, corrupting
        the memory image of MS-DOS (can lead to unpredictable behavior during
        boot; remedy is to use a local stack)

    ■  Incorrect break-address reporting by the initialization routine (can
        lead to a system crash if the next driver loaded overwrites vital parts
        of the driver)

    ■  Improper BPBs supplied by the build BPB routine, or incorrect BPB
        pointer array supplied by the initialization routine (can lead to many
        confusing problems, ranging from out-of-memory errors to system boot
        failure)

    ■  Incorrect reporting of the number of bytes or sectors successfully
        transferred at the time an I/O error occurs (can manifest itself as a
        system crash after you enter R to the Abort, Retry, Ignore? prompt)

    Although the interface between the DOS kernel and the device driver is
    fairly simple, it is also quite strict. The command-code routines must
    perform exactly as they are defined, or the system will behave
    erratically. Even a very subtle discrepancy in the action of a
    command-code routine can have unexpectedly large global effects.

Chapter 15  Filters

    A filter is, essentially, a program that operates on a stream of
    characters. The source and destination of the character stream can be
    files, another program, or almost any character device. The transformation
    applied by the filter to the character stream can range from an operation
    as simple as character substitution to one as elaborate as generating
    splines from sets of coordinates.

    The standard MS-DOS package includes three simple filters: SORT, which
    alphabetically sorts text on a line-by-line basis; FIND, which searches a
    text stream to match a specified string; and MORE, which displays text one
    screenful at a time.


System Support for Filters

    The operation of a filter program relies on two MS-DOS features that first
    appeared in version 2.0: standard devices and redirectable I/O.

    The standard devices are represented by five handles that are originally
    established by COMMAND.COM. Each process inherits these handles from its
    immediate parent. Thus, the standard device handles are already open when
    a process acquires control of the system, and it can use them with
    Interrupt 21H Functions 3FH and 40H for read and write operations
    without further preliminaries. The default assignments of the standard
    device handles are as follows:

    Handle             Name                                 Default device
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    0                  stdin (standard input)               CON
    1                  stdout (standard output)             CON
    2                  stderr (standard error)              CON
    3                  stdaux (standard auxiliary)          AUX
    4                  stdprn (standard printer)            PRN
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    The CON device is assigned by default to the system's keyboard and video
    display. AUX and PRN are respectively associated by default with COM1 (the
    first physical serial port) and LPT1 (the first parallel printer port).
    You can use the MODE command to redirect LPT1 to one of the serial ports;
    the MODE command will also redirect PRN.

    When executing a program by entering its name at the COMMAND.COM prompt,
    you can redirect the standard input, the standard output, or both from
    their default device (CON) to another file, a character device, or a
    process. You do this by including one of the special characters &lt;, &gt;, &gt;&gt;,
    and | in the command line, in the form shown on the following page.

    Symbol             Effect
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    &lt; file             Takes standard input from the specified file instead of
                        the keyboard.

    &lt; device           Takes standard input from the named device instead of
                        the keyboard.

    &gt; file             Sends standard output to the specified file instead of
                        the display.

    &gt;&gt; file            Appends standard output to the current contents of the

    p1 | p2            Routes standard output of program p1 to become the
                        standard input of program p2. (Output of p1 is said to
                        be piped to p2.)
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    For example, the command

    C&gt;SORT &lt;MYFILE.TXT &gt;PRN &lt;Enter&gt;

    causes the SORT filter to read its input from the file MYFILE.TXT, sort
    the lines alphabetically, and write the resulting text to the character
    device PRN (the logical name for the system's list device).

    The redirection requested by the &lt;, &gt;, &gt;&gt;, and | characters takes place at
    the level of COMMAND.COM and is invisible to the program it affects. Any
    other process can achieve a similar effect by redirecting the standard
    input and standard output with Int 21H Function 46H before calling the
    EXEC function (Int 21H Function 4BH) to run a child process.

    Note that if a program circumvents MS-DOS to perform its input and output,
    either by calling ROM BIOS functions or by manipulating the keyboard or
    video controller directly, redirection commands placed in the program's
    command line do not have the expected effect.


How Filters Work

    By convention, a filter program reads its text from the standard input
    device and writes the results of its operations to the standard output
    device. When it reaches the end of the input stream, the filter simply
    terminates. As a result, filters are both flexible and simple.

    Filter programs are flexible because they do not know, and do not care
    about, the source of the data they process or the destination of their
    output. Thus, any character device that has a logical name within the
    system (CON, AUX, COM1, COM2, PRN, LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, and so on), any file
    on any block device (local or network) known to the system, or any other
    program can supply a filter's input or accept its output. If necessary,
    you can concatenate several functionally simple filters with pipes to
    perform very complex operations.

    Although flexible, filters are also simple because they rely on their
    parent processes to supply standard input and standard output handles that
    have already been appropriately redirected. The parent must open or create
    any necessary files, check the validity of logical character-device names,
    and load and execute the preceding or following process in a pipe. The
    filter concerns itself only with the transformation it applies to the
    data.


Building a Filter

    Creating a new filter for MS-DOS is a straightforward process. In its
    simplest form, a filter need only use the handle-oriented read (Interrupt
    21H Function 3FH) and write (Interrupt 21H Function 40H) functions to
    get characters or lines from standard input and send them to standard
    output, performing any desired alterations on the text stream on a
    character-by-character or line-by-line basis.

    Figures 15-1 and 15-2 contain prototype character-oriented filters in
    both assembly language and C. In these examples, the translate routine,
    which is called for each character transferred from the standard input to
    the standard output, does nothing at all. As a result, both filters
    function rather like a very slow COPY command. You can quickly turn these
    primitive filters into useful programs by substituting your own translate
    routine.

    If you try out these programs, you'll notice that the C prototype filter
    runs much faster than its MASM equivalent. This is because the C runtime
    library is performing hidden blocking and deblocking of the input and
    output stream, whereas the MASM filter is doing exactly what it appears to
    be doing: making two calls to MS-DOS for each character processed. You can
    easily restore the MASM filter's expected speed advantage by adapting it
    to read and write lines instead of single characters.

The CLEAN Filter

    As a more practical example of MS-DOS filters, let's look at a simple but
    very useful filter called CLEAN. Figures 15-3 and 15-4 show the
    assembly-language and C source code for this filter. CLEAN processes a
    text stream by stripping the high bit from all characters, expanding tabs
    to spaces, and throwing away all control codes except carriage returns,
    linefeeds, and formfeeds. Consequently, CLEAN can transform almost any
    kind of word-processed document file into a plain ASCII text file.

    Figure 15-4.  CLEAN.C, the source code for the C version of the CLEAN
    filter.

    When using the CLEAN filter, you must specify the source and destination
    files with redirection parameters in the command line; otherwise, CLEAN
    will simply read the keyboard and write to the display. For example, to
    filter the document file MYFILE.DOC and leave the result in the file
    MYFILE.TXT, you would enter the following command:

    C&gt;CLEAN &lt;MYFILE.DOC &gt;MYFILE.TXT  &lt;Enter&gt;

    (Note that the original file, MYFILE.DOC, is unchanged.)

    One valuable application of this filter is to rescue assembly-language
    source files. If you accidentally edit such a source file in document
    mode, the resulting file may cause the assembler to generate spurious or
    confusing error messages. CLEAN lets you turn the source file back into
    something the assembler can cope with, without losing the time you spent
    to edit it.

    Another handy application for CLEAN is to list a word-processed document
    in raw form on the printer, using a command such as

    C&gt;CLEAN &lt;MYFILE.DOC &gt;PRN  &lt;Enter&gt;

    Contrasting the C and assembly-language versions of this filter provides
    some interesting statistics. The C version contains 79 lines and compiles
    to a 5889-byte .EXE file, whereas the assembly-language version contains
    265 lines and builds an 1107-byte .EXE file. The size and execution-speed
    advantages of implementing such tools in assembly language is obvious,
    even compared with such an excellent compiler as the Microsoft C
    Optimizing Compiler. However, you must balance performance considerations
    against the time and expense required for programming, particularly when a
    program will not be used very often.

Chapter 16  Compatibility and Portability

    At the beginning of this book, we surveyed the history of MS-DOS and saw
    that new versions come along nearly every year, loosely coupled to the
    introduction of new models of personal computers. We then focused on each
    of the mainstream issues of MS-DOS applications programming: the user
    interface; mass storage; memory management; control of "child" processes;
    and special classes of programs, such as filters, interrupt handlers, and
    device drivers.

    It's now time to close the circle and consider two global concerns of
    MS-DOS programming: compatibility and portability. For your programs to
    remain useful in a constantly evolving software and hardware environment,
    you must design them so that they perform reliably on any reasonable
    machine configuration and exploit available system resources; in addition,
    you should be able to upgrade them easily for new versions of MS-DOS, for
    new machines, and, for that matter, for completely new environments such
    as MS OS/2.


Degrees of Compatibility

    If we look at how existing MS-DOS applications use the operating system
    and hardware, we find that we can assign them to one of four categories:

    ■  MS-DOS─compatible applications

    ■  ROM BIOS─compatible applications

    ■  Hardware-compatible applications

    ■  "Ill-behaved" applications

    MS-DOS─compatible applications use only the documented MS-DOS function
    calls and do not call the ROM BIOS or access the hardware directly. They
    use ANSI escape sequences for screen control, and their input and output
    is redirectable. An MS-DOS─compatible application will run on any machine
    that supports MS-DOS, regardless of the machine configuration. Because of
    the relatively poor performance of MS-DOS's built-in display and serial
    port drivers, few popular programs other than compilers, assemblers, and
    linkers fall into this category.

    ROM BIOS─compatible applications use the documented MS-DOS and ROM BIOS
    function calls but do not access the hardware directly. As recently as
    three years ago, this strategy might have significantly limited a
    program's potential market. Today, the availability of high-quality
    IBM-compatible ROM BIOSes from companies such as Phoenix has ensured the
    dominance of the IBM ROM BIOS standard; virtually no machines are being
    sold in which a program cannot rely as much on the ROM BIOS interface as
    it might on the MS-DOS interface. However, as we noted in Chapters 6 and
    7, the ROM BIOS display and serial drivers are still not adequate to the
    needs of high-performance interactive applications, so the popular
    programs that fall into this category are few.

    Hardware-compatible applications generally use MS-DOS functions for mass
    storage, memory management, and the like, and use a mix of MS-DOS and ROM
    BIOS function calls and direct hardware access for their user interfaces.
    The amount of hardware dependence in such programs varies widely. For
    example, some programs only write characters and attributes into the video
    controller's regen buffer and use the ROM BIOS to switch modes and
    position the cursor; others bypass the ROM BIOS video driver altogether
    and take complete control of the video adapter. As this book is written,
    the vast majority of the popular MS-DOS "productivity" applications (word
    processors, databases, telecommunications programs, and so on) can be
    placed somewhere in this category.

    "Ill-behaved" applications are those that rely on undocumented MS-DOS
    function calls or data structures, interception of MS-DOS or ROM BIOS
    interrupts, or direct access to mass storage devices (bypassing the MS-DOS
    file system). These programs tend to be extremely sensitive to their
    environment and typically must be "adjusted" in order to work with each
    new MS-DOS version or PC model. Virtually all popular terminate-
    and-stay-resident (TSR) utilities, network programs, and disk
    repair/optimization packages are in this category.

Writing Well-Behaved MS-DOS Applications

    Your choice of MS-DOS functions, ROM BIOS functions, or direct hardware
    access to solve a particular problem must always be balanced against
    performance needs; and, of course, the user is the final judge of a
    program's usefulness and reliability. Nevertheless, you can follow some
    basic guidelines, outlined below, to create well-behaved applications that
    are likely to run properly under future versions of MS-DOS and under
    multitasking program managers that run on top of MS-DOS, such as Microsoft
    Windows.

    Program structure

    Design your programs as .EXE files with separate code, data, and stack
    segments; shun the use of .COM files. Use the Microsoft conventions for
    segment names and attributes discussed in Chapter 3. Inspect the
    environment block at runtime to locate your program's overlays or data
    files; don't "hard-wire" a directory location into the program.

    Check host capabilities

    Obtain the MS-DOS version number with Int 21H Function 30H during your
    program's initialization and be sure that all of the functions your
    program requires are actually available. If you find that the host MS-DOS
    version is inadequate, be careful about which functions you call to
    display an error message and to terminate.

    Use the enhanced capabilities of MS-DOS versions 3 and 4 when your program
    is running under those versions. For example, you can specify a sharing
    mode when opening a file with Int 21H Function 3DH, you can create
    temporary or unique files with Int 21H Functions 5AH and 5BH, and you
    can obtain extended error information (including a recommended recovery
    strategy) with Int 21H Function 59H. Section 2 of this book contains
    version-dependency information for each MS-DOS function.

    Input and output

    Use the handle file functions exclusively and extend full path support
    throughout your application (being sure to allow for the maximum possible
    path length during user input of filenames). Use buffered I/O whenever
    possible. The device drivers in MS-DOS versions 2.0 and later can handle
    strings as long as 64 KB, and performance will be improved if you write
    fewer, larger records as opposed to many short ones.

    Avoid the use of FCBs, the Int 25H or Int 26H functions, or the ROM BIOS
    disk driver. If you must use FCBs, close them when you are done with them
    and don't move them around while they are open. Avoid reopening FCBs that
    are already open or reclosing FCBs that have already been closed──these
    seemingly harmless practices can cause problems when network software is
    running.

    Memory management

    During your program's initialization, release any memory that is not
    needed by the program. (This is especially important for .COM programs.)
    If your program requires extra memory for buffers or tables, allocate that
    memory dynamically when it is needed and release it as soon as it is no
    longer required. Use expanded memory, when it is available, to minimize
    your program's demands on conventional memory.

    As a general rule, don't touch any memory that is not owned by your
    program. To set or inspect interrupt vectors, use Int 21H Functions 25H
    and 35H rather than editing the interrupt vector table directly. If you
    alter the contents of interrupt vectors, save their original values and
    restore them before the program exits.

    Process management

    To isolate your program from dependencies on PSP structure and relocation
    information, use the EXEC function (Int 21H Function 4BH) when loading
    overlays or other programs. Terminate your program with Int 21H Function
    4CH, passing a zero return code if the program executes successfully and
    a nonzero code if an error is encountered. Your program's parent can then
    test this return code with Int 21H Function 4DH or, in a batch file, with
    the IF ERRORLEVEL statement.

    Exception handling

    Install Ctrl-C (Int 23H) and critical-error (Int 24H) handlers so that
    your program cannot be terminated unexpectedly by the user's entry of
    Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Break or by a hardware I/O failure. This is particularly
    important if your program uses expanded memory or installs its own
    interrupt handlers.

ROM BIOS and Hardware-Compatible Applications

    When you feel the need to introduce ROM BIOS or hardware dependence for
    performance reasons, keep it isolated to small, well-documented procedures
    that can be easily modified when the hardware changes. Use macros and
    equates to hide hardware characteristics and to avoid spreading "magic
    numbers" throughout your program.

    Check host capabilities

    If you use ROM BIOS functions in your program, you must check the machine
    model at runtime to be sure that the functions your program needs are
    actually available. There is a machine ID byte at F000:FFFEH whose value
    is interpreted as follows:

    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    F8H                      PS/2 Models 70 and 80

    F9H                      PC Convertible

    FAH                      PS/2 Model 30

    FBH                      PC/XT (later models)

    FCH                      PC/AT, PC/XT-286, PS/2 Models 50 and 60

    FDH                      PCjr

    FEH                      PC/XT (early models)

    FFH                      PC "Classic"
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    In some cases, submodels can be identified; see Int 15H Function C0H on
    page 573. Section 3 of this book contains version-dependency information
    for each ROM BIOS function.

    When writing your own direct video drivers, you must determine the type
    and capabilities of the video adapter by a combination of Int 10H calls,
    reading ports, and inspection of the ROM BIOS data area at 0040:0000H and
    the memory reserved for the EGA or VGA ROM BIOS, among other things. The
    techniques required are beyond the scope of this book but are well
    explained in Programmer's Guide to PC and PS/2 Video Systems (Microsoft
    Press, 1987).

    Avoid unstable hardware

    Some areas of IBM personal computer architecture have remained remarkably
    stable from the original IBM PC, based on a 4.77 MHz 8088, to today's PS/2
    Model 80, based on a 20 MHz 80386. IBM's track record for upward
    compatibility in its video and serial communications controllers has been
    excellent; in many cases, the same hardware-dependent code that was
    written for the original IBM PC runs perfectly well on an IBM PS/2 Model
    80. Other areas of relative hardware stability are:

    ■  Sound control via port 61H

    ■  The 8253 timer chip's channels 0 and 2 (ports 40H, 42H, and 43H)

    ■  The game adapter at port 201H

    ■  Control of the interrupt system via the 8259 PIC's mask register at
        port 21H

    However, direct sound generation and manipulation of the 8253 timer or
    8259 PIC are quite likely to cause problems if your program is run under a
    multitasking program manager such as Microsoft Windows or DesqView.

    Keyboard mapping, the keyboard controller, and the floppy and fixed disk
    controllers are areas of relative hardware instability. Programs that
    bypass MS-DOS for keyboard or disk access are much less likely to function
    properly across the different PC models and are also prone to interfere
    with each other and with well-behaved applications.


OS/2 Compatibility

    MS-DOS is upwardly compatible in several respects with OS/2, Microsoft's
    multitasking protected-mode virtual memory operating system for 80286 and
    80386 computers. The OS/2 graphical user interface (the Presentation
    Manager) is nearly identical to Microsoft Windows 2.0. OS/2 versions 1.0
    and 1.1 use exactly the same disk formats as MS-DOS so that files may
    easily be moved between MS-DOS and OS/2 systems. Most important, OS/2
    includes a module called the "DOS Compatibility Environment" or "3.x Box,"
    which can run one MS-DOS application at a time alongside protected-mode
    OS/2 applications.

    The 3.x Box traps Int 21H function calls and remaps them into OS/2
    function calls, emulating an MS-DOS 3.3 environment with the file-sharing
    module (SHARE.EXE) loaded but returning a major version number of 10
    instead of 3 for Int 21H Function 30H. The 3.x Box also supports most ROM
    BIOS calls, either by emulating their function or by interlocking the
    device and then calling the original ROM BIOS routine. In addition, the
    3.x Box maintains the ROM BIOS data area, provides timer ticks to
    applications via Int 1CH, and supports certain undocumented MS-DOS
    services and data structures so that most TSR utilities can function
    properly. Nevertheless, the 3.x Box's emulation of MS-DOS is not perfect,
    and you must be aware of certain constraints on MS-DOS applications
    running under OS/2.

    The most significant restriction on an MS-DOS application is that it does
    not receive any CPU cycles when it is in the background. That is, when a
    protected-mode application has been "selected," so that the user can
    interact with it, the MS-DOS application is frozen. If the MS-DOS
    application has captured any interrupt vectors (such as the serial port or
    timer tick), these interrupts will not be serviced until the application
    is again selected and in the foreground. OS/2 must freeze MS-DOS
    applications when they are in the background because they execute in real
    mode and are thus not subject to hardware memory protection; nothing else
    ensures that they will not interfere with a protected-mode process that
    has control of the screen and keyboard.

    Use of FCBs is restricted in the 3.x Box, as it is under MS-DOS 3 or 4
    with SHARE.EXE loaded. A file cannot be opened with an FCB if any other
    process is using it. The number of FCBs that can be simultaneously opened
    is limited to 16 or to the number specified in a CONFIG.SYS FCBS=
    directive. Even when the handle file functions are used, these functions
    may fail unexpectedly due to the activity of other processes (for example,
    if a protected-mode process has already opened the file with "deny all"
    sharing mode); most MS-DOS applications are not written with file sharing
    in mind, and they do not handle such errors gracefully.

    Direct writes to a fixed disk using Int 26H or Int 13H are not allowed.
    This prevents the file system from being corrupted, because protected-mode
    applications running concurrently with the MS-DOS application may also be
    writing to the same disk. Imagine the mess if a typical MS-DOS unerase
    utility were to alter the root directory and FAT at the same time that a
    protected-mode database program was updating its file and indexes!

    MS-DOS applications that attempt to reprogram the 8259 to move the
    interrupt vector table or that modify interrupt vectors already belonging
    to an OS/2 device driver are terminated by the operating system. MS-DOS
    applications can change the 8259's interrupt-mask register, disable and
    reenable interrupts at their discretion, and read or write any I/O port.
    The obvious corollary is that an MS-DOS program running in the 3.x Box can
    crash the entire OS/2 system at any time; this is the price for allowing
    real-mode applications to run at all.

Porting MS-DOS Applications to OS/2

    The application program interface (API) provided by OS/2 to protected-mode
    programs is quite different from the familiar Int 21H interface of MS-DOS
    and the OS/2 3.x Box. However, the OS/2 API is functionally a proper
    superset of MS-DOS. This makes it easy to convert well-behaved MS-DOS
    applications to run in OS/2 protected mode, whence they can be enhanced to
    take advantage of OS/2's virtual memory, multitasking, and interprocess
    communication capabilities.

    To give you a feeling for both the nature of the OS/2 API and the
    practices that should be avoided in MS-DOS programming if portability to
    OS/2 is desired, I will outline my own strategy for converting existing
    MS-DOS assembly-language programs to OS/2. For the purposes of discussion,
    I have divided the conversion process into five steps and have assigned
    each an easily remembered buzzword:

    1.  Segmentation

    2.  Rationalization

    3.  Encapsulation

    4.  Conversion

    5.  Optimization

    The first three stages can (and should) be performed and tested in the
    MS-DOS environment; only the last two require OS/2 and the protected-mode
    programming tools. As you read on, you may notice that an MS-DOS program
    that follows the compatibility guidelines presented earlier in this
    chapter requires relatively little work to make it run in protected mode.
    This is the natural benefit of working with the operating system instead
    of against it.

    Segmentation

    Most of the 80286's protected-mode capabilities revolve around a change in
    the way memory is addressed. In real mode, the 80286 essentially emulates
    an 8088/86 processor, and the value in a segment register corresponds
    directly to a physical memory address. MS-DOS runs on the 80286 in real
    mode.

    When an 80286 is running in protected mode, as it does under OS/2, an
    additional level of indirection is added to memory addressing.☼ A segment
    register holds a selector, which is an index to a table of descriptors. A
    descriptor defines the physical address and length of a memory segment,
    its characteristics (executable, read-only data, or read/write data) and
    access rights, and whether the segment is currently resident in RAM or has
    been swapped out to disk. Each time a program loads a segment register or
    accesses memory, the 80286 hardware checks the associated descriptor and
    the program's privilege level, generating a fault if the selector or
    memory operation is not valid. The fault acts like a hardware interrupt,
    allowing the operating system to regain control and take the appropriate
    action.

    This scheme of memory addressing in protected mode has two immediate
    consequences for application programs. The first is that application
    programs can no longer perform arithmetic on the contents of segment
    registers (because selectors are magic numbers and have no direct
    relationship to physical memory addresses) or use segment registers for
    storage of temporary values. A program must not load a segment register
    with anything but a legitimate selector provided by the OS/2 loader or
    resulting from an OS/2 memory allocation function call. The second
    consequence is that a program must strictly segregate machine code
    ("text") from data, placing them in separate segments with distinct
    selectors (because a selector that is executable is not writable, and vice
    versa).

    Accordingly, the first step in converting a program for OS/2 is to turn it
    into a .EXE-type program that uses the Microsoft segment, class, and group
    conventions described in Chapter 3. At minimum, the program must have one
    code segment and one data segment, and should declare a group──with the
    special name DGROUP──that contains the "near" data segment, stack, and
    local heap (if any). At the same time, you should remove or rewrite any
    code that performs direct manipulation of segment values.

    After restructuring and segmentation, reassemble and link your program and
    check to be sure it still works as expected under MS-DOS. Changing or
    adding segmentation often uncovers hidden addressing assumptions in the
    code, so it is best to track these problems down before making other
    substantive changes to the program.

    Rationalization

    Once you've successfully segmented your program so that it can be linked
    and executed as a .EXE file under MS-DOS, the next step is to rationalize
    your code. By rationalization I mean converting your program into a
    completely well-behaved MS-DOS application.

    First, you must ruthlessly eliminate any elements that manipulate the
    peripheral device adapters directly, alter interrupt priorities, edit the
    system interrupt-vector table, or depend on CPU speed or characteristics
    (such as timing loops). In protected mode, control of the interrupt system
    is completely reserved to the operating system and its device drivers, I/O
    ports may be read or written by an application only under very specific
    conditions, and timing loops burn up CPU cycles that can be used by other
    processes.

    As I mentioned earlier in this chapter, display routines constitute the
    most common area of hardware dependence in an MS-DOS application. Direct
    manipulation of the video adapter and its regen buffer poses obvious
    difficulties in a multitasking, protected-memory environment such as OS/2.
    For porting purposes, you must convert all routines that write text to the
    display, modify character attributes, or affect cursor shape or position
    into Int 21H Function 40H calls using ANSI escape sequences or into ROM
    BIOS Int 10H calls. Similarly, you must convert all hardware-dependent
    keyboard operations to Int 21H Function 3FH or ROM BIOS Int 16H calls.

    Once all hardware dependence has been expunged from your program, your
    next priority is to make it well-behaved in its use of system memory.
    Under MS-DOS an application is typically handed all remaining memory in
    the system to do with as it will; under OS/2 the converse is true: A
    process is initially allocated only enough memory to hold its code,
    declared data storage, and stack. You can make the MS-DOS loader behave
    like the OS/2 loader by linking your application with the /CPARMAXALLOC
    switch. Alternatively, your program can give up all extra memory during
    its initialization with Int 21H Function 4AH, as recommended earlier in
    this chapter.

    After your program completes its initialization sequence, it should
    dynamically obtain and release any additional memory it may require for
    buffers and tables with MS-DOS Int 21H Functions 48H and 49H. To ensure
    compatibility with protected mode, limit the size of any single allocated
    block to 65,536 bytes or less, even though MS-DOS allows larger blocks to
    be allocated.

    Finally, you must turn your attention to file and device handling. Replace
    any calls to FCB file functions with their handle-based equivalents,
    because OS/2 does not support FCBs in protected mode at all. Check
    pathnames for validity within the application; although MS-DOS and the 3.x
    Box silently truncate a name or extension, OS/2 refuses to open or create
    a file in protected mode if the name or extension is too long and returns
    an error instead. Replace any use of the predefined handles for the
    standard auxiliary and standard list devices with explicit opens of COM1,
    PRN, LPT1, and so on, using the resulting handle for read and write
    operations. OS/2 does not supply processes with standard handles for the
    serial communications port or printer.

    Encapsulation

    When you reach this point, with a well-behaved, segmented MS-DOS
    application in hand, the worst of a port to OS/2 is behind you. You are
    now ready to prepare your program for true conversion to protected-mode
    operation by encapsulating, in individual subroutines, every part of the
    program that is specific to the host operating system. The objective here
    is to localize the program's "knowledge" of the environment into small
    procedures that can be subsequently modified without affecting the
    remainder of the program.

    As an example of encapsulation, consider a typical call by an MS-DOS
    application to write a string to the standard output device (Figure
    16-1). In order to facilitate conversion to OS/2, you would replace every
    instance of such a write to a file or device with a call to a small
    subroutine that "hides" the mechanics of the actual operating-system
    function call, as illustrated in Figure 16-2.

    Another candidate for encapsulation, which does not necessarily involve an
    operating-system function call, is the application's code to gain access
    to command-line parameters, environment-block variables, and the name of
    the file it was loaded from. Under MS-DOS, this information is divided
    between the program segment prefix (PSP) and the environment block, as we
    saw in Chapters 3 and 12; under OS/2, there is no such thing as a PSP,
    and the program filename and command-line information are appended to the
    environment block.

    particular sequence writes a string to the standard output device. Since
    the standard output might be redirected to a file without the program's
    knowledge, it must also check that all of the requested characters were
    actually written; if the returned length is less than the requested
    length, this usually indicates that the standard output has been
    redirected to a disk file and that the disk is full.

    Figure 16-2.  Code from Figure 16-1 after "encapsulation." The portion of
    the code that is operating-system dependent has been isolated inside a
    subroutine that is called from other points within the application.

    When you have completed the encapsulation of system services and access to
    the PSP and environment, subject your program once more to thorough
    testing under MS-DOS. This is your last chance, while you are still
    working in a familiar milieu and have access to your favorite debugging
    tools, to detect any subtle errors you may have introduced during the
    three conversion steps discussed thus far.

    Conversion

    Next, you must rewrite each system-dependent procedure you created during
    the encapsulation stage to conform to the OS/2 protected-mode API. In
    contrast to MS-DOS functions, which are actuated through software
    interrupts and pass parameters in registers, OS/2 API functions are
    requested through a far call to a named entry point. Parameters are passed
    on the stack, along with the addresses of variables within the calling
    program's data segment that will receive any results returned by the
    function. The status of an operation is returned in register AX──zero if
    the function succeeded, an error code otherwise. All other registers are
    preserved.

    Although it is not my intention here to provide a detailed introduction to
    OS/2 programming, Figure 16-3 illustrates the final form of our previous
    example, after conversion for OS/2. Note especially the addition of the
    extrn statement, the wlen variable, and the simulation of the MS-DOS
    function status. This code may not be elegant, but it serves the purpose
    of limiting the necessary changes to a very small portion of the source
    file. Some OS/2 functions (such as DosOpen) require parameters that have
    no counterpart under MS-DOS; you can usually select reasonable values for
    these extra parameters that will make their existence temporarily
    invisible to the remainder of the application.

    Figure 16-3.  Code from Figure 16-2 after "conversion." The MS-DOS
    function call has been replaced with the equivalent OS/2 function call.
    Since the knowledge of the operating system has been hidden inside the
    subroutine by the previous encapsulation step, the surrounding program's
    requests for write operations should run unchanged. Note that the OS/2
    function had to be declared as an external name with the "far" attribute,
    and that a variable named wlen was added to the data segment of the
    application to receive the actual number of bytes written.

    Figures 16-4, 16-5, and 16-6 list the OS/2 services that are equivalent
    to selected MS-DOS and ROM BIOS Int 21H, Int 10H, and Int 16H calls.
    MS-DOS functions related to FCBs and PSPs are not included in these tables
    because OS/2 does not support either of these structures. The MS-DOS
    terminate-and-stay-resident functions are also omitted. Because OS/2 is a
    true multitasking system, a process doesn't need to terminate in order to
    stay resident while another process is running.

    Optimization

    Once your program is running in protected mode, it is time to unravel some
    of the changes made for purposes of conversion and to introduce various
    optimizations. Three obvious categories should be considered:

    1.  Modifying the program's user-interface code for the more powerful OS/2
        keyboard and display API functions.

    2.  Incorporating 80286-specific machine instructions where appropriate.

    3.  Revamping the application to exploit the OS/2 facilities that are
        unique to protected mode. (Of course, the application benefits from
        OS/2's virtual memory capabilities automatically; it can allocate
        memory until physical memory and disk swapping space are exhausted.)

    Modifying subroutines that encapsulate user input and output to take
    advantage of the additional functionality available under OS/2 is
    straight-forward, and the resulting performance improvements can be quite
    dramatic. For example, the OS/2 video driver offers a variety of services
    that are far superior to the screen support in MS-DOS and the ROM BIOS,
    including high-speed display of strings and attributes at any screen
    position, "reading back" selected areas of the display into a buffer, and
    scrolling in all four directions.

    The 80286-specific machine instructions can be very helpful in reducing
    code size and increasing execution speed. The most useful instructions are
    the shifts and rotates by an immediate count other than one, the
    three-operand multiply where one of the operands is an immediate (literal)
    value, and the push immediate value instruction (particularly handy for
    setting up OS/2 function calls). For example, in Figure 16-3, the
    sequence

    mov     ax,offset DGROUP:wlen
    push    ax

    could be replaced by the single instruction

    push    offset DGROUP:wlen

    Restructuring an application to take full advantage of OS/2's
    protected-mode capabilities requires close study of both the application
    and the OS/2 API, but such study can pay off with sizable benefits in
    performance, ease of maintenance, and code sharing. Often, for instance,
    different parts of an application are concerned with I/O devices of vastly
    different speeds, such as the keyboard, disk, and video display. It both
    simplifies and enhances the application to separate these elements into
    subprocesses (called threads in OS/2) that execute asynchronously,
    communicate through shared data structures, and synchronize with each
    other, when necessary, using semaphores.

    As another example, when several applications are closely related and
    contain many identical or highly similar procedures, OS/2 allows you to
    centralize those procedures in a dynamic link library. Routines in a
    dynamic link library are bound to a program at its load time (rather than
    by LINK, as in the case of traditional runtime libraries) and are shared
    by all the processes that need them. This reduces the size of each
    application .EXE file and allows more efficient use of memory. Best of
    all, dynamic link libraries drastically simplify code maintenance; the
    routines in the libraries can be debugged or improved at any time, and the
    applications that use them will automatically benefit the next time they
    are executed.

SECTION 2  MS-DOS FUNCTIONS REFERENCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


Notes to the Reader

    This section documents the services that the MS-DOS kernel provides to
    application programs via software interrupts 20H─2FH. Each MS-DOS function
    is described in the same format:

    ■ A heading containing the function's name, software interrupt and
    function number, and an icon indicating the MS-DOS version in which the
    function was first supported. You can assume that the function is
    available in all subsequent MS-DOS versions unless explicitly noted
    otherwise.

    ■ A synopsis of the actions performed by the function and the
    circumstances under which it would be used.

    ■ A summary of the function's arguments.

    ■ The results and/or error indicators returned by the function. A
    comprehensive list of error codes can be found in the entry for Int 21H
    Function 59H.

    ■ Notes describing special uses or dependencies of the function.

    ■ A skeleton example of the function's use, written in assembly language.

    Version icons used in the synopsis, arguments, results, or Notes sections
    refer to specific minor or major versions, unless they include a + sign to
    indicate a version and all subsequent versions.

    For purposes of clarity, the examples may include instructions that would
    not be necessary if the code were inserted into a working program. For
    example, most of the examples explicitly set the segment registers when
    passing the address of a filename or buffer to MS-DOS; in real
    applications, the segment registers are usually initialized once at entry
    to the program and left alone thereafter.

Terminate process
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Terminates the current process. This is one of several methods that a
    program can use to perform a final exit. MS-DOS then takes the following
    actions:

    ■ All memory belonging to the process is released.

    ■ File buffers are flushed and any open handles for files or devices owned
    by the process are closed.

    ■ The termination handler vector (Int 22H) is restored from PSP:000AH.

    ■ The Ctrl-C handler vector (Int 23H) is restored from PSP:000EH.

    ■ [2.0+] The critical-error handler vector (Int 24H) is restored from
    PSP:0012H.

    ■ Control is transferred to the termination handler.

    If the program is returning to COMMAND.COM, control transfers to the
    resident portion, and the transient portion is reloaded if necessary. If a
    batch file is in progress, the next line of the file is fetched and
    interpreted; otherwise, a prompt is issued for the next user command.

Call with:

    CS            = segment address of program segment prefix

Returns:

    Nothing

Notes:

    ■ Any files that have been written to using FCBs should be closed before
    performing this exit call; otherwise, data may be lost.

    ■ Other methods of performing a final exit are:

    ∙ Int 21H Function 00H

    ∙ Int 21H Function 31H

    ∙ Int 21H Function 4CH

    ∙ Int 27H

    ■ [2.0+] Int 21H Functions 31H and 4CH are the preferred methods for
    termination, since they allow a return code to be passed to the parent
    process.

    ■ [3.0+] If the program is running on a network, it should remove all
    locks it has placed on file regions before terminating.

Example:

    Terminate the current program, returning control to the program's parent.

            .
            .
            .

Function 00H
Terminate process
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Terminates the current process. This is one of several methods that a
    program can use to perform a final exit. MS-DOS then takes the following
    actions:

    ■ All memory belonging to the process is released.

    ■ File buffers are flushed and any open handles for files or devices owned
    by the process are closed.

    ■ The termination handler vector (Int 22H) is restored from PSP:000AH.

    ■ The Ctrl-C handler vector (Int 23H) is restored from PSP:000EH.

    ■ [2.0+] The critical-error handler vector (Int 24H) is restored from
    PSP:0012H.

    ■ Control is transferred to the termination handler.

    If the program is returning to COMMAND.COM, control transfers to the
    resident portion, and the transient portion is reloaded if necessary. If a
    batch file is in progress, the next line of the file is fetched and
    interpreted; otherwise, a prompt is issued for the next user command.

Call with:

Returns:

    Nothing

Notes:

    ■ Any files that have been written to using FCBs should be closed before
    performing this exit call; otherwise, data may be lost.

    ■ Other methods of performing a final exit are:

    ∙ Int 20H

    ∙ Int 21H Function 31H

    ∙ Int 21H Function 4CH&lt;21H4CH&gt;

    ∙ Int 27H

    ■ [2.0+] Int 21H Functions 31H and 4CH are the preferred methods for
    termination, since they allow a return code to be passed to the parent
    process.

Function 01H
Character input with echo
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    [1] Inputs a character from the keyboard, then echoes it to the display.
    If no character is ready, waits until one is available.

    [2.0+] Reads a character from the standard input device and echoes it to
    the standard output device. If no character is ready, waits until one is
    available. Input can be redirected. (If input has been redirected, there
    is no way to detect EOF.)

Call with:

    AH            = 01H

Returns:

    AL            = 8-bit input data

Notes:

    ■ If the standard input is not redirected, and the character read is a
    Ctrl-C, an Int 23H is executed. If the standard input is redirected, a
    Ctrl-C is detected at the console, and BREAK is ON, an Int 23H is
    executed.

    ■ To read extended ASCII codes (such as the special function keys F1 to
    F10) on the IBM PC and compatibles, you must call this function twice.
    The first call returns the value 00H to signal the presence of an
    extended code.

    ■ See also Int 21H Functions 06H, 07H, and 08H, which provide character
    input with various combinations of echo and/or Ctrl-C sensing.

    ■ [2.0+] You can also read the keyboard by issuing a read (Int 21H
    Function 3FH) using the predefined handle for the standard input
    (0000H), if input has not been redirected, or a handle obtained by
    opening the logical device CON.

Example:

    Read one character from the keyboard into register AL, echo it to the
    display, and store it in the variable char.

    char    db      0               ; input character
            .
            .
            .

            mov     char,al         ; save character
            .

Function 02H
Character output
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    [1] Outputs a character to the currently active video display.

    [2.0+] Outputs a character to the standard output device. Output can be
    redirected. (If output is redirected, there is no way to detect disk
    full.)

Call with:

    AH            = 02H
    DL            = 8-bit data for output

Returns:

    Nothing

Notes:

    ■ If a Ctrl-C is detected at the keyboard after the requested character is
    output, an Int 23H is executed.

    ■ If the standard output has not been redirected, a backspace code (08H)
    causes the cursor to move left one position. If output has been
    redirected, the backspace code does not receive any special treatment.

    ■ [2.0+] You can also send strings to the display by performing a write
    (Int 21H Function 40H) using the predefined handle for the standard
    output (0001H), if output has not been redirected, or a handle obtained
    by opening the logical device CON.

Example:

    Send the character "*" to the standard output device.

            .
            .
            .
            mov     ah,2            ; function number

Function 03H
Auxiliary input
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    [1] Reads a character from the first serial port.

    [2.0+] Reads a character from the standard auxiliary device. The default
    is the first serial port (COM1).

Call with:

    AH            = 03H

Returns:

    AL            = 8-bit input data

Notes:

    ■ In most MS-DOS systems, the serial device is unbuffered and is not
    interrupt-driven. If the auxiliary device sends data faster than your
    program can process it, characters may be lost.

    ■ At startup on the IBM PC, PC-DOS initializes the first serial port to
    2400 baud, no parity, 1 stop bit, and 8 data bits. Other implementations
    of MS-DOS may initialize the serial device differently.

    ■ There is no way for a user program to read the status of the auxiliary
    device or to detect I/O errors (such as lost characters) through this
    function call. On the IBM PC, more precise control can be obtained by
    calling ROM BIOS Int 14H or by driving the communications controller
    directly.

    ■ If a Ctrl-C is detected at the keyboard, an Int 23H is executed.

    ■ [2.0+] You can also input from the auxiliary device by requesting a read
    (Int 21H Function 3FH) using the predefined handle for the standard
    auxiliary device (0003H) or using a handle obtained by opening the
    logical device AUX.

Example:

    Read a character from the standard auxiliary input and store it in the
    variable char.

    char    db      0               ; input character
            .
            .

Function 04H
Auxiliary output
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    [1] Outputs a character to the first serial port.

    [2.0+] Outputs a character to the standard auxiliary device. The default
    is the first serial port (COM1).

Call with:

    AH            = 04H
    DL            = 8-bit data for output

Returns:

    Nothing

Notes:

    ■ If the output device is busy, this function waits until the device is
    ready to accept a character.

    ■ There is no way to poll the status of the auxiliary device using this
    function. On the IBM PC, more precise control can be obtained by calling
    ROM BIOS Int 14H or by driving the communications controller directly.

    ■ If a Ctrl-C is detected at the keyboard, an Int 23H is executed.

    ■ [2.0+] You can also send strings to the auxiliary device by performing a
    write (Int 21H Function 40H) using the predefined handle for the
    standard auxiliary device (0003H) or using a handle obtained by opening
    the logical device AUX.

Example:

    Output a "*'' character to the auxiliary device.

            .
            .
            .
            mov     ah,4            ; function number

Function 05H
Printer output
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    [1] Sends a character to the first list device (PRN or LPT1).

    [2.0+] Sends a character to the standard list device. The default device
    is the printer on the first parallel port (LPT1), unless explicitly
    redirected by the user with the MODE command.

Call with:

    AH            = 05H
    DL            = 8-bit data for output

Returns:

    Nothing

Notes:

    ■ If the printer is busy, this function waits until the printer is ready
    to accept the character.

    ■ There is no standardized way to poll the status of the printer under
    MS-DOS.

    ■ If a Ctrl-C is detected at the keyboard, an Int 23H is executed.

    ■ [2.0+] You can also send strings to the printer by performing a write
    (Int 21H Function 40H) using the predefined handle for the standard
    printer device (0004H) or using a handle obtained by opening the logical
    device PRN or LPT1.

Example:

    Output the character "*'' to the list device.

Function 06H
Direct console I/O
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Used by programs that need to read and write all possible characters and
    control codes without any interference from the operating system.

    [1] Reads a character from the keyboard or writes a character to the
    display.

    [2.0+] Reads a character from the standard input device or writes a
    character to the standard output device. I/O may be redirected. (If I/O
    has been redirected, there is no way to detect EOF or disk full.)

Call with:

    AH            = 06H
    DL            = function requested

                    00H─FEH   if output request
                    0FFH      if input request

Returns:

    If called with DL = 00H─0FEH

    Nothing

    If called with DL = FFH and a character is ready

    Zero flag     = clear
    AL            = 8-bit input data

    If called with DL = FFH and no character is ready

    Zero flag     = set

Notes:

    ■ No special action is taken upon entry of a Ctrl-C when this service is
    used.

    ■ To read extended ASCII codes (such as the special function keys F1 to

Function 08H
Character input without echo
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    [1] Reads a character from the keyboard without echoing it to the display.
    If no character is ready, waits until one is available.

    [2.0+] Reads a character from the standard input device without echoing it
    to the standard output device. If no character is ready, waits until one
    is available. Input may be redirected. (If input has been redirected,
    there is no way to detect EOF.)

Call with:

    AH            = 08H

Returns:

    AL            = 8-bit input data

Notes:

    ■ If the standard input is not redirected, and the character read is a
    Ctrl-C, an Int 23H is executed. If the standard input is redirected, a
    Ctrl-C is detected at the console, and BREAK is ON, an Int 23H is
    executed. To avoid possible interruption by a Ctrl-C, use Int 21H
    Function 07H instead.

    ■ To read extended ASCII codes (such as the special function keys F1 to
    F10) on the IBM PC and compatibles, you must call this function twice.
    The first call returns the value 00H to signal the presence of an
    extended code.

    ■ See also Int 21H Functions 01H, 06H, and 07H, which provide character
    input with various combinations of echo and/or Ctrl-C sensing.

    ■ [2.0+] You can also read the keyboard by issuing a read (Int 21H
    Function 3FH) using the predefined handle for the standard input
    (0000H), if input has not been redirected, or a handle obtained by
    opening the logical device CON.

Example:

    Read a character from the standard input without echoing it to the
    display, allowing possible detection of Ctrl-C, and store the character in
    the variable char.

    char    db      0
            .

Function 09H
Display string
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    [1] Sends a string of characters to the display.

    [2.0+] Sends a string of characters to the standard output device. Output
    may be redirected. (If output has been redirected, there is no way to
    detect disk full.)

Call with:

    AH            = 09H
    DS:DX         = segment:offset of string

Returns:

    Nothing

Notes:

    ■ The string must be terminated with the character $ (24H), which is not
    transmitted. Any other ASCII codes, including control codes, can be
    embedded in the string.

    ■ See Int 21H Functions 02H and 06H for single-character output to the
    video display or standard output device.

    ■ If a Ctrl-C is detected at the keyboard, an Int 23H is executed.

    ■ [2.0+] You can also send strings to the display by performing a write
    (Int 21H Function 40H) using the predefined handle for the standard
    output (0001H), if it has not been redirected, or a handle obtained by
    opening the logical device CON.

Example:

    Send the string Hello World, followed by a carriage return and line feed,
    to the standard output device.

    cr      equ     0dh
    lf      equ     0ah

    msg     db      'Hello World',cr,lf,'$'

Function 0AH (10)
Buffered keyboard input
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    [1] Reads a line from the keyboard and places it in a user-designated
    buffer. The characters are echoed to the display.

    [2.0+] Reads a string of bytes from the standard input device, up to and
    including an ASCII carriage return (0DH), and places them in a
    user-designated buffer. The characters are echoed to the standard output
    device. Input may be redirected. (If input has been redirected, there is
    no way to detect EOF.)

Call with:

    AH            = 0AH
    DS:DX         = segment:offset of buffer

Returns:

    Nothing (data placed in buffer)

Notes:

    ■ The buffer used by this function has the following format:

    Byte          Contents
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    0             maximum number of characters to read, set by program
    1             number of characters actually read (excluding carriage
                    return), set
                    by MS-DOS
    2+            string read from keyboard or standard input, terminated by
                    a carriage return (0DH)
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    ■ If the buffer fills to one fewer than the maximum number of characters
    it can hold, subsequent input is ignored and the bell is sounded until a
    carriage return is detected.

    ■ This input function is buffered with type-ahead capability, and all of
    the standard keyboard editing commands are active.

    ■ If the standard input is not redirected, and a Ctrl-C is detected at the
    console, an Int 23H is executed. If the standard input is redirected, a
    Ctrl-C is detected at the console, and BREAK is ON, an Int 23H is
    executed.

    ■ See Int 21H Functions 01H, 06H, 07H, and 08H for single-character input
    from the keyboard or standard input device.

    ■ [2.0+] You can also read strings from the keyboard by performing a read
    (Int 21H Function 3FH) using the predefined handle for the standard
    input (0000H), if it has not been redirected, or a handle obtained by
    opening the logical device CON.

Example:

    Read a string that is a maximum of 80 characters long from the standard
    input device, placing it in the buffer named buff.

    buff    db      81              ; maximum length of input
            db      0               ; actual length of input
            db      81 dup (0)      ; actual input placed here

Function 0BH (11)
Check input status
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    [1] Checks whether a character is available from the keyboard.

    [2.0+] Checks whether a character is available from the standard input
    device. Input can be redirected.

Call with:

    AH            = 0BH

Returns:

    AL            = 00H if no character is available
                    FFH if at least one character is available

Notes:

    ■ [1] If a Ctrl-C is detected, an Int 23H is executed.

    ■ [2.0+] If the standard input is not redirected, and a Ctrl-C is detected
    at the console, an Int 23H is executed. If the standard input is
    redirected, a Ctrl-C is detected at the console, and BREAK is ON, an Int
    23H is executed.

    ■ If a character is waiting, this function will continue to return a true
    flag until the character is consumed with a call to Int 21H Function
    01H, 06H, 07H, 08H, 0AH, or 3FH.

    ■ This function is equivalent to IOCTL Int 21H Function 44H Subfunction
    06H.

Example:

    Test whether a character is available from the standard input.

Function 0CH (12)
Flush input buffer and then input
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    [1] Clears the type-ahead buffer and then invokes one of the keyboard
    input functions.

    [2.0+] Clears the standard input buffer and then invokes one of the
    character input functions. Input can be redirected.

Call with:

    AH            = 0CH
    AL            = number of input function to be invoked after resetting
                    buffer (must be 01H, 06H, 07H, 08H, or 0AH)

    (if AL = 0AH)

    DS:DX         = segment:offset of input buffer

Returns:

    (if called with AL = 01H, 06H, 07H, or 08H)

    AL            = 8-bit input data

    (if called with AL = 0AH)

    Nothing (data placed in buffer)

Notes:

    ■ The function exists to allow a program to defeat MS-DOS's type-ahead
    feature. It discards any characters that are waiting in MS-DOS's
    internal type-ahead buffer, forcing the specified input function to wait
    for a character (usually a keyboard entry) that is truly entered after
    the program's request.

    ■ The presence or absence of Ctrl-C checking during execution of this
    function depends on the function number placed in register AL.

    ■ A function number in AL other than 01H, 06H, 07H, 08H, or 0AH simply
    flushes the input buffer and returns control to the calling program.

Example:

    Clear the type-ahead buffer, then wait for a character to be entered,
    echoing it and then returning it in AL. Store the character in the
    variable char.

    char    db      0
            .
            .

            int     21h             ; transfer to MS-DOS
            mov     char,al         ; save character

Function 0DH (13)
Disk reset
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Flushes all file buffers. All data that has been logically written by user
    programs, but has been temporarily buffered within MS-DOS, is physically
    written to the disk.

Call with:

    AH            = 0DH

Returns:

    Nothing

Notes:

    ■ This function does not update the disk directory for any files that are
    still open. If your program fails to properly close all files before the
    disk is removed, and files have changed size, the data forced out to the
    disk by this function may still be inaccessible because the directory
    entries will not be correct.

    ■ [3.3+] Int 21H Function 68H (Commit File) should be used in preference
    to this function, since it also updates the disk directory.

Example:

    Flush all MS-DOS internal disk buffers.

Function 0EH (14)
Select disk
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Selects the specified drive to be the current, or default, disk drive and
    returns the total number of logical drives in the system.

Call with:

    AH            = 0EH
    DL            = drive code (0 = A, 1 = B, etc.)

Returns:

    AL            = number of logical drives in system

Notes:

    ■ [1] 16 drive designators (0 through 0FH) are available.

    ■ [2] 63 drive designators (0 through 3FH) are available.

    ■ [3.0+] 26 drive designators (0 through 19H) are available.

    ■ To preserve upward compatibility, new applications should limit
    themselves to the drive letters A─Z (0 = A, 1 = B, etc.).

    ■ Logical drives means the total number of block devices: floppy disks,
    simulated disk drives (RAMdisks), and hard-disk drives. A single
    physical hard-disk drive is frequently partitioned into two or more
    logical drives.

    ■ [1] [2] In single-drive IBM PC─compatible systems, the value 2 is
    returned in AL, because PC-DOS supports two logical drives (A: and B:)
    on the single physical floppy-disk drive. The actual number of physical
    drives in the system can be determined with ROM BIOS Int 11H.

    ■ [3.0+] The value returned in AL is either 5 or the drive code
    corresponding to the LASTDRIVE entry (if any) in CONFIG.SYS, whichever
    is greater.

Example:

    Make drive B the current (default) disk drive. Save the total number of
    logical drives in the system in the variable drives.

Function 0FH (15)
Open file
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Opens a file and makes it available for subsequent read/write operations.

Call with:

    AH            = 0FH
    DS:DX         = segment:offset of file control block

Returns:

    If function successful (file found)

    AL            = 00H

    and FCB filled in by MS-DOS as follows:

    drive field (offset 00H)              = 1 for drive A, 2 for drive B, etc.
    current block field (offset 0CH)      = 00H
    record size field (offset 0EH)        = 0080H
    [2.0+] size field (offset 10H)        = file size from directory
    [2.0+] date field (offset 14H)        = date stamp from directory
    [2.0+] time field (offset 16H)        = time stamp from directory

    If function unsuccessful (file not found)

    AL            = 0FFH

Notes:

    ■ If your program is going to use a record size other than 128 bytes, it
    should set the record-size field at FCB offset 0EH after the file is
    successfully opened and before any other disk operation.

    ■ If random access is to be performed, the calling program must also set
    the FCB relative-record field (offset 21H) after successfully opening
    the file.

    ■ For format of directory time and date, see Int 21H Function 57H.

    ■ [2.0+] Int 21H Function 3DH, which allows full access to the
    hierarchical directory structure, should be used in preference to this
    function.

    ■ [3.0+] If the program is running on a network, the file is opened for
    read/write access in compatibility sharing mode.

Example:

    Attempt to open the file named QUACK.DAT on the default disk drive.

    myfcb   db      0               ; drive = default
            db      'QUACK   '      ; filename, 8 characters

Function 10H (16)
Close file
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Closes a file, flushes all MS-DOS internal disk buffers associated with
    the file to disk, and updates the disk directory if the file has been
    modified or extended.

Call with:

    AH            = 10H

    AL            = 00H

    If function unsuccessful (file not found in directory)

    AL            = FFH

Notes:

    ■ [1] [2] MS-DOS versions 1 and 2 do not reliably detect a floppy-disk
    change, and an error can occur if the user changes disks while a file is
    still open on that drive. In the worst case, the directory and file
    allocation table of the newly inserted disk can be damaged or destroyed.

    ■ [2.0+] Int 21H Function 3EH should be used in preference to this
    function.

Example:

    Close the file that was previously opened using the file control block
    named myfcb.

    and buffer at current disk transfer area (DTA) address filled in as an
    unopened normal FCB or extended FCB, depending on which type of FCB was
    input to function

    If function unsuccessful (no matching filename found)

    AL            = FFH

Notes:

    ■ Use Int 21H Function 1AH to set the DTA to point to a buffer of
    adequate size before calling this function.

    ■ The wildcard character ? is allowed in the filename in all versions of
    MS-DOS. In versions 3.0 and later, the wildcard character * may also be
    used in a filename. If ? or * is used, this function returns the first
    matching filename.

    ■ An extended FCB must be used to search for files that have the system,
    hidden, read-only, directory, or volume-label attributes.

    ■ If an extended FCB is used, its attribute byte determines the type of
    search that will be performed. If the attribute byte contains 00H, only
    ordinary files are found. If the volume-label attribute bit is set, only
    volume labels will be returned (if any are present). If any other
    attribute or combination of attributes is set (such as hidden, system,
    or read-only), those files and all ordinary files will be matched.

    ■ [2.0+] Int 21H Function 4EH, which allows full access to the
    hierarchical directory structure, should be used in preference to this
    function.

Example:

    Search for the first file with the extension .COM in the current
    directory.

Function 12H (18)
Find next file
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Given that a previous call to Int 21H Function 11H has been successful,
    returns the next matching filename (if any).

Call with:

    AH            = 12H
    DS:DX         = segment:offset of file control block

Returns:

    If function successful (matching filename found)

    AL            = 00H

    and buffer at current disk transfer area (DTA) address set up as an
    unopened normal FCB or extended FCB, depending on which type of FCB was
    originally input to Int 21H Function 11H

    If function unsuccessful (no more matching filenames found)

    AL            = FFH

Notes:

    ■ This function assumes that the FCB used as input has been properly
    initialized by a previous call to Int 21H Function 11H (and possible
    subsequent calls to Int 21H Function 12H) and that the filename or
    extension being searched for contained at least one wildcard character.

    ■ As with Int 21H Function 11H, it is important to use Int 21H Function
    1AH to set the DTA to a buffer of adequate size before calling this
    function.

    ■ [2.0+] Int 21H Functions 4EH and 4FH, which allow full access to the
    hierarchical directory structure, should be used in preference to this
    function.

Example:

    Assuming a previous successful call to function 11H, search for the next
    file with the extension .COM in the current directory. If the DTA has not
    been changed since the previous search, another call to Function 1AH is
    not necessary.

Function 13H (19)
Delete file
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Deletes all matching files from the current directory on the default or

Returns:

    If function successful (file or files deleted)

    If function unsuccessful (no matching files were found, or at least one
    matching file was read-only)

    AL            = FFH

Notes:

    ■ The wildcard character ? is allowed in the filename; if ? is present and
    there is more than one matching filename, all matching files will be
    deleted.

    ■ [2.0+] Int 21H Function 41H, which allows full access to the

Function 14H (20)
Sequential read
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Reads the next sequential block of data from a file, then increments the
    file pointer appropriately.

Call with:

    AH            = 14H
    DS:DX         = segment:offset of previously opened file control block

Returns:

                    03H       if partial record read at end of file

Notes:

    ■ The record is read into memory at the current disk transfer area (DTA)
    address, specified by the most recent call to Int 21H Function 1AH. If
    the size of the record and the location of the buffer are such that a
    segment overflow or wraparound would occur, the function fails with a
    return code of 02H.

    ■ The number of bytes of data to be read is specified by the record-size
    field (offset 0EH) of the file control block (FCB).

    ■ The file location of the data that will be read is specified by the
    combination of the current block field (offset 0CH) and current record
    field (offset 20H) of the file control block (FCB). These fields are
    also automatically incremented by this function.

    ■ If a partial record is read at the end of file, it is padded to the
    requested record length with zeros.

    ■ [3.0+] If the program is running on a network, the user must have Read
    access rights to the directory containing the file to be read.

Example:

    Read 1024 bytes of data from the file specified by the previously opened
    file control block myfcb.

    myfcb   db      0               ; drive = default

Function 15H (21)
Sequential write
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Writes the next sequential block of data into a file, then increments the
    file pointer appropriately.

Call with:

                    02H       if segment wrap

Notes:

    ■ The record is written (logically, not necessarily physically) to the
    disk from memory at the current disk transfer area (DTA) address,
    specified by the most recent call to Int 21H Function 1AH. If the size
    of the record and the location of the buffer are such that a segment

    code of 02H.

    ■ The number of bytes of data to be written is specified by the
    record-size field (offset 0EH) of the file control block (FCB).

    ■ The file location of the data that will be written is specified by the
    combination of the current block field (offset 0CH) and current record
    field (offset 20H) of the file control block (FCB). These fields are

Create file
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Creates a new directory entry in the current directory or truncates any

    [2.0+] date field (offset 14H)        = date stamp from directory
    [2.0+] time field (offset 16H)        = time stamp from directory

    If function unsuccessful (directory full)

    AL            = FFH

Notes:

    ■ Since an existing file with the specified name is truncated to zero
    length (i.e., all data in that file is irretrievably lost), this
    function must be used with caution.

    ■ If this function is called with an extended file control block (FCB),
    the new file may be assigned a special attribute, such as hidden or
    system, during its creation by setting the appropriate bit in the
    extended FCB's attribute byte.

    ■ Since this function also opens the file, a subsequent call to Int 21H
    Function 0FH is not required.

    ■ For format of directory time and date, see Int 21H Function 57H.

    ■ [2.0+] Int 21H Functions 3CH, 5AH, 5BH, and 6CH, which provide full
    access to the hierarchical directory structure, should be used in
    preference to this function.

    ■ [3.0+] If the program is running on a network, the user must have Create
    rights to the directory that will contain the new file.

Example:

Returns:

    If function successful (one or more files renamed)

    If function unsuccessful (no matching files, or new filename matched an
    existing file)

    AL            = FFH

Notes:

    ■ The special file control block has a drive code, filename, and extension
    in the usual position (bytes 0 through 0BH) and a second filename
    starting 6 bytes after the first (offset 11H).

    ■ The ? wildcard character can be used in the first filename. Every file
    matching the first file specification will be renamed to match the
    second file specification.

    ■ If the second file specification contains any ? wildcard characters, the
    corresponding letters in the first filename are left unchanged.

    ■ The function terminates if the new name to be assigned to a file matches
    that of an existing file.

Function 19H (25)
Get current disk
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Returns the drive code of the current, or default, disk drive.

Call with:

    AH            = 19H

Returns:

    AL            = drive code (0 = A, 1 = B, etc.)

Notes:

    ■ To set the default drive, use Int 21H Function 0EH.

    ■ Some other Int 21H functions use drive codes beginning at 1 (that is,
    1 = A, 2 = B, etc.) and reserve drive code zero for the default drive.

Example:

    Get the current disk drive and save the code in the variable cdrive.

    cdrive  db      0               ; current drive code
            .
            .

Function 1AH (26)
Set DTA address
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Specifies the address of the disk transfer area (DTA) to be used for
    subsequent FCB-related function calls.

Call with:

    AH            = 1AH
    DS:DX         = segment:offset of disk transfer area

Returns:

    Nothing

Notes:

    ■ If this function is never called by the program, the DTA defaults to a
    128-byte buffer at offset 0080H in the program segment prefix.

    ■ In general, it is the programmer's responsibility to ensure that the
    buffer area specified is large enough for any disk operation that will
    use it. The only exception to this is that MS-DOS will detect and abort
    disk transfers that would cause a segment wrap.

    ■ Int 21H Function 2FH can be used to determine the current disk transfer
    address.

    ■ The only handle-type operations that rely on the DTA address are the
    directory search functions, Int 21H Functions 4EH and 4FH.

Example:

    Set the current disk transfer area address to the buffer labeled buff.

    buff    db      128 dup (?)
            .
            .

Function 1BH (27)
Get default drive data
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Obtains selected information about the default disk drive and a pointer to
    the media identification byte from its file allocation table.

Call with:

    AH            = 1BH

Returns:

    If function successful

    AL            = sectors per cluster
    DS:BX         = segment:offset of media ID byte
    CX            = size of physical sector (bytes)
    DX            = number of clusters for default drive

    If function unsuccessful (invalid drive or critical error)

    AL            = FFH

Notes:

    ■ The media ID byte has the following meanings:

    0F0H           3.5-inch double-sided, 18 sectors
                    or "other"
    0F8H           fixed disk
    0F9H           5.25-inch double-sided, 15 sectors
                    or 3.5-inch double-sided, 9 sectors
    0FCH           5.25-inch single-sided, 9 sectors
    0FDH           5.25-inch double-sided, 9 sectors

    0FFH           5.25-inch double-sided, 8 sectors

    ■ To obtain information about disks other than the one in the default
    drive, use Int 21H Function 1CH or 36H.

    ■ [1] The address returned in DS:BX points to a copy of the first sector
    of the actual FAT, with the media ID byte in the first byte.

    ■ [2.0+] The address returned in DS:BX points only to a copy of the media
    ID byte from the disk's FAT; the memory above that address cannot be
    assumed to contain the FAT or any other useful information. If direct
    access to the FAT is required, use Int 25H to read it into memory.

Example:

    Determine whether the current disk drive is fixed or removable.

            .
            .
            .
            mov     ah,1bh          ; function number

Function 1CH (28)
Get drive data
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Obtains allocation information about the specified disk drive and a
    pointer to the media identification byte from its file allocation table.

Call with:

    AH            = 1CH
    DL            = drive code (0 = default, 1 = A, etc.)

Returns:

    If function successful

    DS:BX         = segment:offset of media ID byte
    CX            = size of physical sector (bytes)
    DX            = number of clusters for default or specified drive

    If function unsuccessful (invalid drive or critical error)

    AL            = FFH

Notes:

    ■ The media ID byte has the following meanings:

    0F0H           3.5-inch double-sided, 18 sectors
                    or "other"
    0F8H           fixed disk
    0F9H           5.25-inch double-sided, 15 sectors

    0FFH           5.25-inch double-sided, 8 sectors

    ■ In general, this call is identical to Int 21H Function 1BH, except for
    the ability to designate a specific disk drive. See also Int 21H
    Function 36H, which returns similar information.

    ■ [1] The address returned in DS:BX points to a copy of the first sector
    of the actual FAT, with the media ID byte in the first byte.

    ■ [2.0+] The address returned in DS:BX points only to a copy of the media
    ID byte from the disk's FAT; the memory above that address cannot be
    assumed to contain the FAT or any other useful information. If direct
    access to the FAT is required, use Int 25H to read it into memory.

Function 21H (33)
Random read
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Reads a selected record from a file into memory.

Call with:

    AH            = 21H
    DS:DX         = segment:offset of previously opened file control block

Returns:

    AL            = 00H       if read successful
                    01H       if end of file
                    02H       if segment wrap, read canceled
                    03H       if partial record read at end of file

Notes:

    ■ The record is read into memory at the current disk transfer area
    address, specified by the most recent call to Int 21H Function 1AH. It
    is the programmer's responsibility to ensure that this area is large
    enough for any record that will be transferred. If the size and location
    of the buffer are such that a segment overflow or wraparound would
    occur, the function fails with a return code of 02H.

    ■ The file location of the data to be read is determined by the
    combination of the relative-record field (offset 21H) and the
    record-size field (offset 0EH) of the FCB. The default record size is
    128 bytes.

    ■ The current block field (offset 0CH) and current record field (offset
    20H) are updated to agree with the relative-record field as a side
    effect of the function.

    ■ The relative-record field of the FCB is not incremented by this
    function; it is the responsibility of the application to update the FCB
    appropriately if it wishes to read successive records. Compare with Int
    21H Function 27H, which can read multiple records with one function
    call and automatically increments the relative-record field.

    ■ If a partial record is read at end of file, it is padded to the
    requested record length with zeros.

    ■ [3.0+] If the program is running on a network, the user must have Read
    access rights to the directory containing the file to be read.

Example:

    Open the file MYFILE.DAT, set the record length to 1024 bytes, then read
    record number 4 from the file into the buffer named buff.

    myfcb   db      0               ; drive = default

Function 22H (34)
Random write
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Writes data from memory into a selected record in a file.

Call with:

Returns:

                    02H       if segment wrap, write canceled

Notes:

    ■ The record is written (logically, not necessarily physically) to the
    file from memory at the current disk transfer address, specified by the
    most recent call to Int 21H Function 1AH. If the size and location of
    the buffer are such that a segment overflow or wraparound would occur,
    the function fails with a return code of 02H.

    ■ The file location of the data to be written is determined by the
    combination of the relative-record field (offset 21H) and the
    record-size field (offset 0EH) of the FCB. The default record size is
    128 bytes.

    ■ The current block field (offset 0CH) and current record field (offset
    20H) are updated to agree with the relative-record field as a side
    effect of the function.

    ■ The relative-record field of the FCB is not incremented by this
    function; it is the responsibility of the application to update the FCB
    appropriately if it wishes to write successive records. Compare with Int
    21H Function 28H, which can write multiple records with one function
    call and automatically increments the relative-record field.

    ■ If a record is written beyond the current end of file, the space between
    the old end of file and the new record is allocated but not initialized.

    ■ [3.0+] If the program is running on a network, the user must have Write
    access rights to the directory containing the file to be written.

Example:

    Open the file MYFILE.DAT, set the record length to 1024 bytes, write
    record number 4 into the file from the buffer named buff, then close the

Function 23H (35)
Get file size
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Searches for a matching file in the current directory; if one is found,
    updates the FCB with the file's size in terms of number of records.

Call with:

    AH            = 23H
    DS:DX         = segment:offset of unopened file control block

Returns:

    If function successful (matching file found)

    AL            = 00H

    and FCB relative-record field (offset 21H) set to the number of records in
    the file, rounded up if necessary to the next complete record

    If function unsuccessful (no matching file found)

    AL            = FFH

Notes:

    ■ An appropriate value must be placed in the FCB record-size field (offset
    0EH) before calling this function. There is no default record size for
    this function. Compare with the FCB-related open and create functions
    (Int 21H Functions 0FH and 16H), which initialize the FCB for a
    default record size of 128 bytes.

    ■ The record-size field can be set to 1 to find the size of the file in
    bytes.

    ■ Because record numbers are zero based, this function can be used to
    position the FCB's file pointer to the end of file.

Example:

Function 24H (36)
Set relative record number
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Sets the relative-record-number field of a file control block (FCB) to
    correspond to the current file position as recorded in the opened FCB.

Call with:

    AH            = 24H
    DS:DX         = segment:offset of previously opened file control block

Returns:

    AL is destroyed (other registers not affected)

    FCB relative-record field (offset 21H) updated

Notes:

    ■ This function is used when switching from sequential to random I/O
    within a file. The contents of the relative-record field (offset 21H)
    are derived from the record size (offset 0EH), current block (offset
    0CH), and current record (offset 20H) fields of the file control block.

    ■ All four bytes of the FCB relative-record field (offset 21H) should be
    initialized to zero before calling this function.

Example:

    After a series of sequential record transfers have been performed using
    the file control block myfcb, obtain the current relative-record position
    in the file and leave the record number in DX.

    myfcb   db      0               ; drive = default
            db      'MYFILE  '      ; filename, 8 chars

Function 25H (37)
Set interrupt vector
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Initializes a CPU interrupt vector to point to an interrupt handling
    routine.

Call with:

    AH            = 25H
    AL            = interrupt number
    DS:DX         = segment:offset of interrupt handling routine

Returns:

    Nothing

Notes:

    ■ This function should be used in preference to direct editing of the
    interrupt-vector table by well-behaved applications.

    ■ Before an interrupt vector is modified, its original value should be
    obtained with Int 21H Function 35H and saved, so that it can be restored
    using this function before program termination.

Example:

    Install a new interrupt handler, named zdiv, for "divide by zero" CPU
    exceptions.

            .
            .
            .

Function 26H (38)
Create new PSP
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Copies the program segment prefix (PSP) of the currently executing program
    to a specified segment address in free memory, then updates the new PSP to
    make it usable by another program.

Call with:

    AH            = 26H
    DX            = segment of new program segment prefix

Returns:

    Nothing

Notes:

    ■ After the executing program's PSP is copied into the new segment, the
    memory size information in the new PSP is updated appropriately and the
    current contents of the termination (Int 22H), Ctrl-C handler (Int 23H),
    and critical-error handler (Int 24H) vectors are saved starting at
    offset 0AH.

    ■ This function does not load another program or in itself cause one to be
    executed.

    ■ [2.0+] Int 21H Function 4BH (EXEC), which can be used to load and
    execute programs or overlays in either .COM or .EXE format, should be
    used in preference to this function.

Example:

    Create a new program segment prefix 64 KB above the currently executing
    program. This example assumes that the running program was loaded as a
    .COM file so that the CS register points to its PSP throughout its
    execution. If the running program was loaded as a .EXE file, the address
    of the PSP must be obtained with Int 21H Function 62H (under MS-DOS 3.0
    or later) or by saving the original contents of the DS or ES registers at
    entry.

            .

Function 27H (39)
Random block read
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Reads one or more sequential records from a file into memory, starting at
    a designated file location.

Call with:

    AH            = 27H
    CX            = number of records to read
    DS:DX         = segment:offset of previously opened file control block

Returns:

    AL            = 00H       if all requested records read
                    01H       if end of file
                    02H       if segment wrap
                    03H       if partial record read at end of file

    CX            = actual number of records read

Notes:

    ■ The records are read into memory at the current disk transfer area
    address, specified by the most recent call to Int 21H Function 1AH. It
    is the programmer's responsibility to ensure that this area is large
    enough for the group of records that will be transferred. If the size
    and location of the buffer are such that a segment overflow or
    wraparound would occur, the function fails with a return code of 02H.

    ■ The file location of the data to be read is determined by the
    combination of the relative-record field (offset 21H) and the
    record-size field (offset 0EH) of the FCB. The default record size is
    128 bytes.

    ■ After the disk transfer is performed, the current block (offset 0CH),
    current record (offset 20H), and relative-record (offset 21H) fields of
    the FCB are updated to point to the next record in the file.

    ■ If a partial record is read at the end of file, the remainder of the
    record is padded with zeros.

    ■ Compare with Int 21H Function 21H, which transfers only one record per
    function call and does not update the FCB relative-record field.

    ■ [3.0+] If the program is running on a network, the user must have Read
    access rights to the directory containing the file to be read.

Example:

    Read four 1024-byte records starting at record number 8 into the buffer
    named buff, using the file control block myfcb.

    myfcb   db      0               ; drive = default

Function 28H (40)
Random block write
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Writes one or more sequential records from memory to a file, starting at a
    designated file location.

Call with:

    CX            = number of records to write
    DS:DX         = segment:offset of previously opened file control block

Returns:

                    01H       if disk full
                    02H       if segment wrap

    CX            = actual number of records written

Notes:

    ■ The records are written (logically, not necessarily physically) to disk
    from memory at the current disk transfer area address, specified by the
    most recent call to Int 21H Function 1AH. If the size and location of
    the buffer are such that a segment overflow or wraparound would occur,
    the function fails with a return code of 02H.

    ■ The file location of the data to be written is determined by the
    combination of the relative-record field (offset 21H) and the
    record-size field (offset 0EH) of the FCB. The default record size is
    128 bytes.

    ■ After the disk transfer is performed, the current block (offset 0CH),
    current record (offset 20H), and relative-record (offset 21H) fields of
    the FCB are updated to point to the next record in the file.

    ■ If this function is called with CX = 0, no data is written to the disk
    but the file is extended or truncated to the length specified by
    combination of the record-size (offset 0EH) and the relative-record
    (offset 21H) fields of the FCB.

    ■ Compare with Int 21H Function 22H, which transfers only one record per
    function call and does not update the FCB relative-record field.

    ■ [3.0+] If the program is running on a network, the user must have Write
    access rights to the directory containing the file to be written.

                    01H if parsed string contained wildcard characters
                    FFH if drive specifier invalid
    DS:SI         = segment:offset of first character after parsed filename
    ES:DI         = segment:offset of formatted unopened file control block

Notes:

    ■ This function regards the following as separator characters:

    [1]        : . ; ,      = + tab space / " [ ]
    [2.0+]     : . ; ,      = + tab space

    ■ This function regards all control characters and the following as
    terminator characters:

                : . ; ,      = + tab space &lt; &gt; | / " [ ]

    ■ If no valid filename is present in the string to be parsed, upon return
    ES:DI + 1 points to an ASCII blank.

    ■ If the * wildcard character occurs in a filename or extension, it and
    all remaining characters in the corresponding field in the FCB are set
    to ?.

    ■ This function (and file control blocks in general) cannot be used with
    file specifications that include a path.

Example:

    Parse the string fname into the file control block myfcb.

    fname   db      'D:QUACK.DAT',0 ; filename to be parsed

    myfcb   db      37 dup (0)      ; becomes file control block

Function 2AH (42)
Get date
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Obtains the system day of the month, day of the week, month, and year.

Call with:

    AH            = 2AH

Returns:

    CX            = year (1980 through 2099)
    DH            = month (1 through 12)
    DL            = day (1 through 31)

    Under MS-DOS versions 1.1 and later

    AL            = day of the week (0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc.)

Notes:

    ■ This function's register format is the same as that required for Int 21H
    Function 2BH (Set Date).

    ■ This function can be used together with Int 21H Function 2BH to find
    the day of the week for an arbitrary date. The current date is first
    obtained with Function 2AH and saved. The date of interest is then set
    with Function 2BH, and the day of the week for that date is obtained
    with a subsequent call to Function 2AH. Finally, the current date is
    restored with an additional call to Function 2BH, using the values
    obtained with the original Function 2AH call.

Example:

    Obtain the current date and save its components in the variables year,
    day, and month.

    year    dw      0
    month   db      0

Function 2BH (43)
Set date
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Initializes the system clock driver to a specific date. The system time is

Function 2CH (44)
Get time
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Obtains the time of day from the system real-time clock driver, converted
    to hours, minutes, seconds, and hundredths of seconds.

Call with:

    AH            = 2CH

Returns:

    CH            = hours (0 through 23)

Notes:

    ■ This function's register format is the same as that required for Int 21H

    ■ On most IBM PC─compatible systems, the real-time clock does not have a
    resolution of single hundredths of seconds. On such machines, the values
    returned by this function in register DL are discontinuous.

Function 2DH (45)
Set time
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Initializes the system real-time clock to a specified hour, minute,
    second, and hundredth of second. The system date is not affected.

Call with:

    AH            = 2DH
    CH            = hours (0 through 23)
    CL            = minutes (0 through 59)

Function 2EH (46)
Set verify flag
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Turns off or turns on the operating-system flag for automatic
    read-after-write verification of data.

Call with:

    AH            = 2EH
    AL            = 00H       if turning off verify flag
                    01H       if turning on verify flag

    DL            = 00H (MS-DOS versions 1 and 2)

Returns:

    Nothing

Notes:

    ■ Because read-after-write verification slows disk operations, the default
    setting of the verify flag is OFF.

    ■ If a particular disk unit's device driver does not support
    read-after-write verification, this function has no effect.

    ■ The current state of the verify flag can be determined using Int 21H
    Function 54H.

    ■ The state of the verify flag is also controlled by the MS-DOS commands
    VERIFY OFF and VERIFY ON.

Example:

    Save the current state of the system verify flag in the variable vflag,
    then force all subsequent disk writes to be verified.

    vflag   db      0               ; previous verify flag
            .
            .

Function 2FH (47)
Get DTA address
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Obtains the current address of the disk transfer area (DTA) for FCB file
    read/write operations.

Call with:

    AH            = 2FH

Returns:

    ES:BX         = segment:offset of disk transfer area

Note:

    ■ The disk transfer area address is set with Int 21H Function 1AH. The
    default DTA is a 128-byte buffer at offset 80H in the program segment
    prefix.

Example:

    Obtain the current disk transfer area address and save it in the variable
    olddta.

    olddta  dd      ?               ; save disk transfer address
            .

Function 30H (48)
Get MS-DOS version number
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Returns the version number of the host MS-DOS operating system. This
    function is used by application programs to determine the capabilities of
    their environment.

Call with:

    AH            = 30H
    AL            = 00H

Returns:

    If running under MS-DOS version 1

    AL            = 00H

    If running under MS-DOS versions 2.0 or later

    AL            = major version number (MS-DOS 3.10 = 3, etc.)
    AH            = minor version number (MS-DOS 3.10 = 0AH, etc.)
    BH            = Original Equipment Manufacturer's (OEM's) serial number
                    (OEM-dependent──usually 00H for IBM's PC-DOS, 0FFH or
                    other values for MS-DOS)
    BL:CX         = 24-bit user serial number (optional, OEM-dependent)

Notes:

    ■ Because this function was not defined under MS-DOS version 1, it should
    always be called with AL = 00H. In an MS-DOS version 1 environment, AL
    will be returned unchanged.

    ■ Care must be taken not to exit in an unacceptable fashion if an MS-DOS
    version 1 environment is detected. For example, Int 21H Function 4CH
    (Terminate Process with Return Code), Int 21H Function 40H (Write to
    File or Device), and the standard error handle are not available in
    MS-DOS version 1. In such cases a program should display an error
    message using Int 21H Function 09H and then terminate with Int 20H or
    Int 21H Function 00H.

Example:

    Get the MS-DOS version number, terminating the current process with an
    error message if not running under MS-DOS version 2.0 or later.

Function 31H (49)
Terminate and stay resident
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Terminates execution of the currently executing program, passing a return
    code to the parent process, but reserves part or all of the program's
    memory so that it will not be overlaid by the next transient program to be
    loaded. MS-DOS then takes the following actions:

    ■ File buffers are flushed and any open handles for files or devices owned
    by the process are closed.

    ■ The termination handler vector (Int 22H) is restored from PSP:000AH.

    ■ The Ctrl-C handler vector (Int 23H) is restored from PSP:000EH.

    ■ [2.0+] The critical-error handler vector (Int 24H) is restored from
    PSP:0012H.

    ■ Control is transferred to the termination handler.

    If the program is returning to COMMAND.COM, control transfers to the
    resident portion, and the transient portion is reloaded if necessary. If a
    batch file is in progress, the next line of the file is fetched and
    interpreted; otherwise, a prompt is issued for the next user command.

Call with:

    AH            = 31H
    AL            = return code
    DX            = amount of memory to reserve (in paragraphs)

Returns:

    Nothing

Notes:

    ■ This function call is typically used to allow user-written utilities,
    drivers, or interrupt handlers to be loaded as ordinary .COM or .EXE
    programs and then remain resident. Subsequent entrance to the code is
    via a hardware or software interrupt.

    ■ This function attempts to set the initial memory allocation block to the
    length in paragraphs specified in register DX. If other memory blocks
    have been requested by the application using Int 21H Function 48H, they
    will not be released by this function.

    ■ Other methods of performing a final exit are:

    ∙ Int 20H

    ∙ Int 21H Function 00H

    ∙ Int 21H Function 4CH

    ∙ Int 27H

    ■ The return code may be retrieved by a parent process with Int 21H
    Function 4DH (Get Return Code). It can also be tested in a batch file
    with an IF ERRORLEVEL statement. By convention, a return code of zero
    indicates successful execution, and a nonzero return code indicates an
    error.

    ■ This function should not be called by .EXE programs that are loaded at
    the high end of the transient program area (that is, linked with the
    /HIGH switch) because doing so reserves the memory that is normally used
    by the transient part of COMMAND.COM. If COMMAND.COM cannot be reloaded,
    the system will fail.

    ■ [2.0+] This function should be used in preference to Int 27H because it
    supports return codes, allows larger amounts of memory to be reserved,
    and does not require CS to contain the segment of the program segment
    prefix.

    ■ [3.0+] If the program is running on a network, it should remove all
    locks it has placed on file regions before terminating.

Example:

    Exit with a return code of 1 but stay resident, reserving 16 KB of memory
    starting at the program segment prefix of the process.

Function 33H (51)
Get or set break flag, get boot drive
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Obtains or changes the status of the operating system's break flag, which
    influences Ctrl-C checking during function calls. Also returns the system
    boot drive in version 4.0.

Call with:

    If getting break flag

    AH            = 33H
    AL            = 00H

    If setting break flag

    AH            = 33H
    AL            = 01H
    DL            = 00H       if turning break flag OFF
                    01H       if turning break flag ON

    [4] If getting boot drive

    AH            = 33H
    AL            = 05H

Returns:

    If called with AL = 00H or 01H

    DL            = 00H       break flag is OFF
                    01H       break flag is ON

    [4] If called with AL = 05H

    DL            = boot drive (1 = A, 2 = B, etc.)

Notes:

    ■ When the system break flag is on, the keyboard is examined for a Ctrl-C
    entry whenever any operating-system input or output is requested; if
    Ctrl-C is detected, control is transferred to the Ctrl-C handler (Int
    23H). When the break flag is off, MS-DOS only checks for a Ctrl-C entry
    when executing the traditional character I/O functions (Int 21H
    Functions 01H through 0CH).

    ■ The break flag is not part of the local environment of the currently
    executing program; it affects all programs. An application that alters
    the flag should first save the flag's original status, then restore the
    flag before terminating.

Example:

    Save the current state of the system break flag in the variable brkflag,
    then turn the break flag off to disable Ctrl-C checking during most MS-DOS
    function calls.

    brkflag db      0               ; save break flag
            .
            .
            .
                                    ; get current break flag
            mov     ah,33h          ; function number
            mov     al,0            ; AL = 0 to get flag
            int     21h             ; transfer to MS-DOS
            mov     brkflag,dl      ; save current flag

                                    ; now set break flag
            mov     ah,33h          ; function number
            mov     al,1            ; AL = 1 to set flag
            mov     dl,0            ; set break flag OFF
            int     21h             ; transfer to MS-DOS

Function 35H (53)
Get interrupt vector
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Obtains the address of the current interrupt-handler routine for the
    specified machine interrupt.

Call with:

    AH            = 35H
    AL            = interrupt number

Returns:

Note:

    ■ Together with Int 21H Function 25H (Set Interrupt Vector), this
    function is used by well-behaved application programs to modify or
    inspect the machine interrupt vector table.

Example:

    Obtain the address of the current interrupt handler for hardware interrupt
    level 0 (divide by zero) and save it in the variable oldint0.

    oldint0 dd      ?               ; previous handler address

Function 36H (54)
Get drive allocation information
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Obtains selected information about a disk drive, from which the drive's
    capacity and remaining free space can be calculated.

Call with:

    AH            = 36H
    DL            = drive code (0 = default, 1 = A, etc.)

Returns:

    If function successful

    BX            = number of available clusters
    CX            = bytes per sector

    report them as part of the number of available clusters, even though
    they are not assigned to a file.

Example:

    Calculate the capacity of disk drive C in bytes, leaving the result in the
    variable drvsize. (This code assumes that the product of sectors/cluster *
    bytes/sector will not overflow 16 bits.)

Notes:

    ■ The default country code is determined by the COUNTRY= directive in

    Otherwise, the default country code is OEM-dependent.

    ■ The previous contents of register CX may be destroyed by the Get Country
    Information subfunction.

    ■ The case-map call address is the segment:offset of a FAR procedure that
    performs country-specific mapping on character values from 80H through
    0FFH. The procedure must be called with the character to be mapped in
    register AL. If an alternate value exists for that character, it is
    returned in AL; otherwise, AL is unchanged. In general, lowercase
    characters are mapped to their uppercase equivalents, and accented or
    otherwise modified vowels are mapped to their plain vowel equivalents.

    ■ [3.0+] The value in register DX is used by MS-DOS to select between the
    Set Country and Get Country Information subfunctions.

    ■ [3.3+] Int 21H Function 65H (Get Extended Country Information) returns

Function 3CH (60)
Create file
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Given an ASCIIZ pathname, creates a new file in the designated or default
    directory on the designated or default disk drive. If the specified file
    already exists, it is truncated to zero length. In either case, the file
    is opened and a handle is returned that can be used by the program for
    subsequent access to the file.

Call with:

    AH            = 3CH
    CX            = file attribute (bits may be combined)

                    Bit(s)    Significance (if set)
                    0         read-only
                    1         hidden
                    2         system
                    3         volume label
                    4         reserved (0)
                    5         archive
                    6─15      reserved (0)

    DS:DX         = segment:offset of ASCIIZ pathname

Returns:

    If function successful

    Carry flag    = clear
    AX            = handle

    If function failed

    Carry flag    = set
    AX            = error code

Notes:

    ■ The function fails if:

    ∙ any element of the pathname does not exist.

    ∙ the file is being created in the root directory and the root directory
        is full.

    ∙ a file with the same name and the read-only attribute already exists
        in the specified directory.

    ∙ [3.0+] the program is running on a network and the user running the
        program has insufficient access rights.

    ■ A file is usually given a normal (0) attribute when it is created. The
    file's attribute can subsequently be modified with Int 21H Function
    43H.

    ■ [3.0+] A volume label can be created using an attribute of 0008H, if one
    does not already exist. When files are created, bit 3 of the attribute
    parameter should always be clear (0).

    ■ [3.0+] See the entries for Int 21H Functions 5AH and 5BH, which may
    also be used to create files.

    ■ [4.0+] Int 21H Function 6CH combines the services of Functions 3CH,
    3DH, and 5BH.

Example:

    Create and open, or truncate to zero length and open, the file
    C:\MYDIR\MYFILE.DAT, and save the handle for subsequent access to the
    file.

    fname   db      'C:\MYDIR\MYFILE.DAT',0

    fhandle dw      ?
            .

Function 3DH (61)
Open file
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Given an ASCIIZ pathname, opens the specified file in the designated or
    default directory on the designated or default disk drive. A handle is
    returned which can be used by the program for subsequent access to the
    file.

Call with:

    AH            = 3DH

                            1 = child does not inherit handle

    DS:DX         = segment:offset of ASCIIZ pathname

Returns:

    If function successful

    Carry flag    = clear
    AX            = handle

    If function unsuccessful

    Carry flag    = set
    AX            = error code

Notes:

    ■ Any normal, system, or hidden file with a matching name will be opened
    by this function. If the file is read-only, the success of the operation
    also depends on the access code in bits 0─2 of register AL. After
    opening the file, the file read/write pointer is set to offset zero (the
    first byte of the file).

    ■ The function fails if:

    ∙ any element of the pathname does not exist.

    ∙ the file is opened with an access mode of read/write and the file has
        the read-only attribute.

    ∙ [3.0+] SHARE.EXE is loaded and the file has already been opened by one
        or more other processes in a sharing mode that is incompatible with
        the current program's request.

    ■ The file's date and time stamp can be accessed after a successful open
    call with Int 21H Function 57H.

    ■ The file's attributes (hidden, system, read-only, or archive) can be
    obtained with Int 21H Function 43H.

    ■ When a file handle is inherited by a child process or is duplicated with
    Int 21H Function 45H or 46H, all sharing and access restrictions are
    also inherited.

    ■ [2] Only bits 0─2 of register AL are significant; the remaining bits
    should be zero for upward compatibility.

    ■ [3.0+] Bits 4─7 of register AL control access to the file by other
    programs. (Bits 4─6 have no effect unless SHARE.EXE is loaded.)

    ■ [3.0+] A file-sharing error causes a critical-error exception (Int 24H)
    with an error code of 02H. Int 21H Function 59H can be used to obtain
    information about the sharing violation.

    ■ [4.0+] Int 21H Function 6CH combines the services of Functions 3CH,
    3DH, and 5BH.

Example:

    Open the file C:\MYDIR\MYFILE.DAT for both reading and writing, and save
    the handle for subsequent access to the file.

    fname   db      'C:\MYDIR\MYFILE.DAT',0

Function 3EH (62)
Close file
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Given a handle that was obtained by a previous successful open or create
    operation, flushes all internal buffers associated with the file to disk,
    closes the file, and releases the handle for reuse. If the file was
    modified, the time and date stamp and file size are updated in the file's
    directory entry.

Call with:

    AH            = 3EH
    BX            = handle

Returns:

    If function successful

    Carry flag    = clear

    If function unsuccessful

    Carry flag    = set
    AX            = error code

Note:

    ■ If you accidentally call this function with a zero handle, the standard
    input device is closed, and the keyboard appears to go dead. Make sure
    you always call the close function with a valid, nonzero handle.

Example:

    Close the file whose handle is saved in the variable fhandle.

    fhandle dw      0
            .
            .

Function 3FH (63)
Read file or device
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Given a valid file handle from a previous open or create operation, a
    buffer address, and a length in bytes, transfers data at the current
    file-pointer position from the file into the buffer and then updates the
    file pointer position.

Call with:

    DS:DX         = segment:offset of buffer

Returns:

    If function successful

    Carry flag    = clear
    AX            = bytes transferred

    If function unsuccessful

    Carry flag    = set
    AX            = error code

Notes:

    ■ If reading from a character device (such as the standard input) in
    cooked mode, at most one line of input will be read (i.e., up to a
    carriage return character or the specified length, whichever comes
    first).

    ■ If the carry flag is returned clear but AX = 0, then the file pointer
    was already at end of file when the program requested the read.

    ■ If the carry flag is returned clear but AX &lt; CX, then a partial record
    was read at end of file or there is an error.

    ■ [3.0+] If the program is running on a network, the user must have Read
    access rights to the directory and file.

Example:

    Using the file handle from a previous open or create operation, read 1024
    bytes at the current file pointer into the buffer named buff.

    buff    db      1024 dup (?)    ; buffer for read

Function 40H (64)
Write file or device
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Given a valid file handle from a previous open or create operation, a
    buffer address, and a length in bytes, transfers data from the buffer into
    the file and then updates the file pointer position.

Call with:

    AH            = 40H
    BX            = handle
    CX            = number of bytes to write
    DS:DX         = segment:offset of buffer

Returns:

    If function successful

    Carry flag    = clear
    AX            = bytes transferred

    If function unsuccessful

    Carry flag    = set
    AX            = error code

Notes:

    ■ If the carry flag is returned clear but AX &lt; CX, then a partial record
    was written or there is an error. This can be caused by a Ctrl-Z (1AH)
    embedded in the data if the destination is a character device in cooked
    mode or by a disk full condition if the destination is a file.

    ■ If the function is called with CX = 0, the file is truncated or extended
    to the current file pointer position.

    ■ [3.0+] If the program is running on a network, the user must have Write
    access rights to the directory and file.

Example:

    Using the handle from a previous open or create operation, write 1024
    bytes to disk at the current file pointer from the buffer named buff.

    buff    db      1024 dup (?)    ; buffer for write

    fhandle dw      ?               ; contains file handle

Function 41H (65)
Delete file
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Deletes a file from the specified or default disk and directory.

Call with:

    AH            = 41H
    DS:DX         = segment:offset of ASCIIZ pathname

Returns:

    If function successful

    Carry flag    = clear

    If function unsuccessful

    Carry flag    = set
    AX            = error code

Notes:

    ■ This function deletes a file by replacing the first character of its
    filename in the directory with the character e (E5H) and marking the
    file's clusters as "free" in the disk's file allocation table. The
    actual data stored in those clusters is not overwritten.

    ■ Only one file at a time may be deleted with this function. Unlike the
    FCB-related Delete File function (Int 21H Function 13H), the * and ?
    wildcard characters are not allowed in the file specification.

    ■ The function fails if:

    ∙ any element of the pathname does not exist.

    ∙ the designated file exists but has the read-only attribute. (Int 21H
        Function 43H can be used to examine and modify a file's attribute
        before attempting to delete it.)

    ∙ [3.0+] the program is running on a network, and the user running the
        program has insufficient access rights.

Example:

    Delete the file named MYFILE.DAT from the directory \MYDIR on drive C.

Function 42H (66)
Set file pointer
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Sets the file location pointer relative to the start of file, end of file,
    or current file position.

Call with:

    AH            = 42H
    AL            = method code
                    00H absolute offset from start of file
                    01H signed offset from current file pointer
                    02H signed offset from end of file
    BX            = handle
    CX            = most significant half of offset
    DX            = least significant half of offset

Returns:

    If function successful

    Carry flag    = clear
    DX            = most significant half of resulting file pointer
    AX            = least significant half of resulting file pointer

    If function unsuccessful

    Carry flag    = set
    AX            = error code

Notes:

    ■ This function uses a method code and a double-precision (32-bit) value
    to set the file pointer. The next record read or written in the file
    will begin at the new file pointer location. No matter what method is
    used in the call to this function, the file pointer returned in DX:AX is
    always the resulting absolute byte offset from the start of file.

    ■ Method 02H may be used to find the size of the file by calling Int 21H
    Function 42H with an offset of 0 and examining the pointer location
    that is returned.

    ■ Using methods 01H or 02H, it is possible to set the file pointer to a
    location that is before the start of file. If this is done, no error is
    returned by this function, but an error will be encountered upon a
    subsequent attempt to read or write the file.

Examples:

    Using the file handle from a previous open or create operation, set the
    current file pointer position to 1024 bytes after the start of file.

    fhandle dw      ?
            .

Function 43H (67)
Get or set file attributes
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Obtains or alters the attributes of a file (read-only, hidden, system, or
    archive) or directory.

Call with:

    AH            = 43H
    AL            = 00H       to get attributes
                    01H       to set attributes

    CX            = file attribute, if AL = 01H (bits can be combined)

                    Bit(s)    Significance (if set)
                    0         read-only

                    6─15      reserved (0)

    DS:DX         = segment:offset of ASCIIZ pathname

Returns:

    If function successful

    Carry flag    = clear
    CX            = file attribute

Notes:

    ■ Bits 3 and 4 of register CX must always be clear (0) when this function
    is called; in other words, you cannot change an existing file into a
    directory or volume label. However, you can assign the "hidden"
    attribute to an existing directory with this function.

    ■ [3.0+] If the program is running on a network, the user must have Create
    access rights to the directory containing the file whose attribute is to
    be modified.

Example:

    Change the attribute of the file D:\MYDIR\MYFILE.DAT to read-only, so that
    it cannot be accidentally modified or deleted by other application
    programs.

    rdonly  equ     01h             ; file attributes
    hidden  equ     02h
    system  equ     04h
    volume  equ     08h

Notes:

    ■ Bits 8─15 of DX correspond to the upper 8 bits of the device-driver
    attribute word.

    ■ Bit 5 of the device information word for a handle associated with a
    character device signifies whether MS-DOS considers that handle to be in
    binary ("raw") mode or ASCII ("cooked") mode. In ASCII mode, MS-DOS
    filters the character stream and may take special action when the
    characters Ctrl-C, Ctrl-S, Ctrl-P, Ctrl-Z, and carriage return are
    detected. In binary mode, all characters are treated as data, and the
    exact number of characters requested is always read or written.

Notes:

    ■ If register DH does not contain 00H, control returns to the program with
    the carry flag set and error code 0001H (invalid function) in register
    AX.

    ■ Bit 5 of the information word for a handle associated with a character
    device signifies whether MS-DOS considers that handle to be in binary
    ("raw") or ASCII ("cooked") mode. See Notes for Int 21H Function 44H
    Subfunction 00H.

Example:

    Place the standard output handle into binary ("raw") mode. This speeds up
    output by disabling checking for Ctrl-C, Ctrl-S, and Ctrl-P between each
    character.

Function 44H (68) Subfunction 02H
IOCTL: read control data from character device driver
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Reads control data from a character-device driver. The length and contents
    of the data are specific to each device driver and do not follow any
    standard format. This function does not necessarily result in any input
    from the physical device.

Call with:

    AH            = 44H
    AL            = 02H
    BX            = handle

Returns:

    If function successful

    Carry flag    = clear
    AX            = bytes read

    and buffer contains control data from driver

    If function unsuccessful

    Carry flag    = set
    AX            = error code

Notes:

    ■ If supported by the driver, this subfunction can be used to obtain
    hardware-dependent status and availability information that is not
    supported by other MS-DOS function calls.

    ■ Character-device drivers are not required to support IOCTL Subfunction
    02H. A program can test bit 14 of the device information word returned
    by IOCTL Subfunction 00H to determine whether the driver supports this
    subfunction. If Subfunction 02H is requested and the driver does not
    have the ability to process control data, control returns to the program
    with the carry flag set and error code 0001H (invalid function) in
    register AX.

Example:

    Read a control string from the standard list driver into the buffer buff.

    stdprn  equ     4               ; standard list handle
    buflen  equ     64              ; length of buffer

    ctllen  dw      ?               ; length of control string
    buff    db      buflen dup (0)  ; receives control string

Returns:

    If function unsuccessful

    Carry flag    = set

Notes:

    ■ If supported by the driver, this subfunction can be used to request
    hardware-dependent operations (such as setting baud rate for a serial
    port) that are not supported by other MS-DOS function calls.

    ■ Character-device drivers are not required to support IOCTL Subfunction
    03H. A program can test bit 14 of the device information word returned
    by IOCTL Subfunction 00H to determine whether the driver supports this
    subfunction. If Subfunction 03H is requested and the driver does not
    have the ability to process control data, control returns to the program
    with the carry flag set and error code 0001H (invalid function) in
    register AX.

Example:

    Write a control string from the buffer buff to the standard list device
    driver. The length of the string is assumed to be in the variable ctllen.

    stdprn  equ     4               ; standard list handle
    buflen  equ     64              ; length of buffer

    ctllen  dw      ?               ; length of control data

Function 44H (68) Subfunction 04H
IOCTL: read control data from block-device driver
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Transfers control data from a block-device driver directly into an
    application program's buffer. The length and contents of the data are
    specific to each device driver and do not follow any standard format. This
    function does not necessarily result in any input from the physical
    device.

Call with:

    and buffer contains control data from device driver

    If function unsuccessful

    Carry flag    = set
    AX            = error code

Notes:

    ■ When supported by the driver, this subfunction can be used to obtain
    hardware-dependent status and availability information that is not
    provided by other MS-DOS function calls.

    ■ Block-device drivers are not required to support IOCTL Subfunction 04H.
    If this subfunction is requested and the driver does not have the
    ability to process control data, control returns to the program with the
    carry flag set and error code 0001H (invalid function) in register AX.

Example:

IOCTL: write control data to block-device driver
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Transfers control data from an application program directly to a
    block-device driver. The length and contents of the control data are
    specific to each device driver and do not follow any standard format. This
    function does not necessarily result in any output to the physical device.

Notes:

    ■ Application programs should not ordinarily attempt to distinguish
    between files on local and remote devices.

    ■ If the network has not been started, control returns to the calling
    program with the carry flag set and error code 0001H (invalid function)
    in register AX.

Example:

Function 44H (68) Subfunction 0BH (11)
IOCTL: change sharing retry count
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Sets the number of times MS-DOS retries a disk operation after a failure
    caused by a file-sharing violation before it returns an error to the
    requesting process. This subfunction is not available unless the
    file-sharing module (SHARE.EXE) is loaded.

Call with:

    AH            = 44H
    AL            = 0BH
    CX            = delays per retry (default = 1)
    DX            = number of retries (default = 3)

Returns:

    If function successful

    Carry flag    = clear

    If function unsuccessful

    Carry flag    = set
    AX            = error code

Notes:

    ■ The length of a delay is a machine-dependent value determined by the CPU
    type and clock speed. Each delay consists of the following instruction
    sequence:

            xor     cx,cx
            loop    $

    which executes 65,536 times before falling out of the loop.

    ■ The sharing retry count affects the behavior of the system as a whole
    and is not a local parameter for the process. If a program changes the
    sharing retry count, it should restore the default values before
    terminating.

Example:

    Change the number of automatic retries for a file-sharing violation to
    five.

    AH            = 44H
    AL            = 0CH
    BX            = handle
    CH            = category (major) code:

    DS:DX         = segment:offset of parameter block

Returns:

    If function successful

    Carry flag    = clear

    and, if called with CL = 65H, 6AH, 6BH, or 7FH

    DS:DX         = segment:offset of parameter block

    If function unsuccessful

    Carry flag    = set
    AX            = error code

Notes:

    ■ If the minor code is 45H (Set Iteration Count) or 65H (Get Iteration
    Count), the parameter block is simply a 2-byte buffer containing or
    receiving the iteration count for the printer. This call is valid only
    for printer drivers that support Output Until Busy, and determines the
    number of times the device driver will wait for the device to signal
    ready before returning from the output call.

    ■ The parameter block for minor code 4DH (End Code Page Preparation) has
    the following format:

            dw      2               ; length of following data
            dw      0               ; (reserved)

    ■ For MS-DOS version 3.3, the parameter block for minor codes 4AH (Select
    Code Page) and 6AH (Query Code Page) has the following format:

            dw      2               ; length of following data
            dw      ?               ; code page ID

    For MS-DOS version 4.0, minor codes 4AH and 6AH also set or get the
    double-byte character set (DBCS) lead byte table, and the following format
    is used:

            dw      (n+2)*2+1       ; length of following data
            dw      ?               ; code page ID

            db      0,0

    ■ The parameter block for minor code 4CH (Start Code Page Preparation) has
    the following format:

            dw      0               ; font type
                                    ; bit 0   = 0 downloaded
                                    ;         = 1 cartridge
                                    ; bits 1-15 = reserved (0)

                                    ;   parameter block
            dw      n               ; number of code pages in
                                    ;   the following list
            dw      ?               ; code page 1
            dw      ?               ; code page 2
            .
            .
            .
            dw      ?               ; code page n

    ■ The parameter block for minor code 6BH (Query Prepare List) has the
    following format, assuming n hardware code pages and m prepared code
    pages (n &lt;= 12, m &lt;= 12):

            dw      (n+m+2)*2       ; length of following data
            dw      n               ; number of hardware code pages
            dw      ?               ; hardware code page 1
            dw      ?               ; hardware code page 2
            .
            .
            .
            dw      ?               ; hardware code page n
            dw      m               ; number of prepared code pages
            dw      ?               ; prepared code page 1
            dw      ?               ; prepared code page 2
            .
            .
            .
            dw      ?               ; prepared code page m

    ■ After a minor code 4CH (Start Code Page Preparation) call, the data
    defining the code page font is written to the driver using one or more
    calls to the IOCTL Write Control Data subfunction (Interrupt 21H,
    Function 44H, Subfunction 03H). The format of the data is device- and
    driver-specific. After the font data has been written to the driver, a
    minor code 4DH (End Code Page Preparation) call must be issued. If no
    data is written to the driver between the minor code 4CH and 4DH calls,
    the driver interprets the newly prepared code pages as hardware code
    pages.

    ■ A special variation of the minor code 4CH (Start Code Page Preparation)
    call, called "Refresh," is required to actually load the peripheral
    device with the prepared code pages. The refresh operation is obtained
    by requesting minor code 4CH with each code page position in the
    parameter block set to -1, followed by an immediate call for minor code
    4DH (End Code Page Preparation).

    ■ [4.0+] For minor codes 5FH (Set Display Information) and 7FH (Get
    Display Information), the parameter block is formatted as follows:

            db      0               ; level (0 in MS-DOS 4.0)
            db      0               ; reserved (must be 0)

Function 44H Subfunction 0DH (13)
IOCTL: generic I/O control for block devices
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Provides a general-purpose mechanism for communication between application
    programs and block-device drivers. Allows a program to inspect or change
    device parameters for a logical drive and to read, write, format, and
    verify disk tracks in a hardware-independent manner.

Call with:

    AH            = 44H
    AL            = 0DH
    BL            = drive code (0 = default, 1 = A, 2 = B, etc.)
    CH            = category (major) code:
                    08H = disk drive
    CL            = function (minor) code:
                    40H = Set Device Parameters
                    41H = Write Track
                    42H = Format and Verify Track
                    47H = Set Access Flag (4.0)
                    60H = Get Device Parameters
                    61H = Read Track
                    62H = Verify Track
                    67H = Get Access Flag (4.0)
    DS:DX         = segment:offset of parameter block

Returns:

    If function successful

    Carry flag    = clear

    and, if called with CL = 60H or 61H

    DS:DX         = segment:offset of parameter block

    If function unsuccessful

    Carry flag    = set
    AX            = error code

Notes:

    ■ The minor code 40H (Set Device Parameters) function must be used before
    an attempt to write, read, format, or verify a track on a logical drive.
    In general, the following sequence applies to any of these operations:

    ∙ Get the current parameters (minor code 60H). Examine and save them.

    ∙ Set the new parameters (minor code 40H).

    ∙ Perform the task.

    ∙ Retrieve the original parameters and restore them with minor code 40H.

    ■ For minor codes 40H (Set Device Parameters) and 60H (Get Device
    Parameters), the parameter block is formatted as follows:

    Special-functions field: offset 00H, length = 1 byte

    Bit(s)    Value      Meaning
    0         0          device BPB field contains a new default BPB

    1         0          use all fields in parameter block
                1          use track layout field only
    2         0          sectors in track may be different sizes (should
                            always be avoided)
                1          sectors in track are all same size; sector numbers
                            range from 1 to the total number of sectors in the
                            track (should always be used)
    3─7       0          reserved

    Device type field: offset 01H, length 1 byte

    Value             Meaning

    Device BPB field: offset 07H, length 31 bytes
    For format of the device BPB, see separate Note below.
    If bit 0 = 0 in special-functions field, this field contains the new
    default BPB for the device.
    If bit 0 = 1 in special-functions field, the BPB in this field is
    returned by the device driver in response to subsequent Build BPB
    requests.

    Track layout field: offset 26H, variable-length table

    Length      Meaning
    Word        number of sectors in track
    Word        number of first sector in track

    .
    .
    .
    Word        number of last sector in track
    Word        size of last sector in track

    ■ The device BPB field is a 31-byte data structure that describes the
    current disk and its control areas. The field is formatted as follows:

    Byte(s)     Meaning
    00H─01H     bytes per sector
    02H         sectors per cluster (allocation unit)
    03─04H      reserved sectors, beginning at sector 0

    0DH─0EH     sectors per track
    0FH─10H     number of heads
    11H─14H     number of hidden sectors
    15H─18H     large number of sectors (if bytes 08H─09H=0)
    19H─1EH     reserved

    ■ When minor code 40H (Set Device Parameters) is used, the number of
    cylinders should not be altered, or some or all of the volume may become
    inaccessible.

    ■ For minor codes 41H (Write Track) and 61H (Read Track), the parameter
    block is formatted as follows:

    Byte(s)     Meaning
    00H         special-functions field (must be 0)
    01H─02H     head
    03H─04H     cylinder
    05H─06H     starting sector
    07H─08H     sectors to transfer
    09H─0CH     transfer buffer address

    ■ For minor codes 42H (Format and Verify Track) and 62H (Verify Track),
    the parameter block is formatted as follows:

    Byte(s)     Meaning
    00H         special-functions field

                Bit(s)      Significance
                0           0 = Format/Verify track
                            1 = Format status call (MS-DOS 4.0 only)
                1─7         reserved (0)
    01H─02H     head
    03H─04H     cylinder

    In MS-DOS 4.0, this function may be called with bit 0 of the
    special-functions field set after a minor code 40H call (Set Device
    Parameters) to determine whether the driver supports the specified
    number of tracks and sectors per track. A status is returned in the
    special-functions field which is interpreted as follows:

    Value       Meaning
    0           specified number of tracks and sectors per track supported
    1           this function not supported by the ROM BIOS
    2           specified number of tracks and sectors per track not
                supported
    3           no disk in drive

    ■ For minor codes 47H (Set Access Flag) and 67H (Get Access Flag), the
    parameter block is formatted as follows:

    Byte        Meaning
    00H         special-functions field (must be 0)
    01H         disk access flag

    When the disk access flag is zero, access to the medium is blocked by
    the driver. The flag is set to zero when the driver detects an
    unformatted medium or a medium with an invalid boot record. When the
    access flag is nonzero, read/write operations to the medium are allowed
    by the driver. A formatting program must clear the disk access flag with
    minor code 47H before it requests minor code 42H (Format and Verify
    Track).

Example:

    Get the device parameter block for disk drive C.

    dbpb    db      128 dup (0)     ; device parameter block
            .
            .

Function 44H (68) Subfunction 0FH (15)
IOCTL: set logical drive map
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Sets the next logical drive code that will be used to reference a block
    device.

Call with:

    AH            = 44H
    AL            = 0FH
    BL            = drive code (0 = default, 1 = A, 2 = B, etc.)

Returns:

    If function successful

    AL            = mapping code

                    00H       if only one logical drive code assigned to the

Note:

    ■ When a physical block device is aliased to more than one logical drive
    code, this function can be used to inform the driver which drive code
    will next be used to access the device.

Example:

    Notify the floppy-disk driver that the next access will be for logical
    drive B.

Function 45H (69)
Duplicate handle
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Given a handle for a currently open device or file, returns a new handle
    that refers to the same device or file at the same position.

Call with:

    AH            = 45H
    BX            = handle to be duplicated

Returns:

    If function successful

    Carry flag    = clear
    AX            = new handle

    If function unsuccessful

    Carry flag    = set
    AX            = error code

Notes:

    ■ A seek, read, or write operation that moves the file pointer for one of
    the two handles also moves the file pointer associated with the other.

    ■ This function can be used to efficiently update the directory for a file
    that has changed in length, without incurring the overhead of closing
    and then reopening the file. The handle for the file is simply
    duplicated with this function and the duplicate is closed, leaving the
    original handle open for further read/write operations.

    ■ [3.3] See also Int 21H Function 68H (Commit File).

Example:

    Duplicate the handle stored in the variable fhandle, then close the
    duplicate. This ensures that all buffered data is physically written to
    disk and that the directory entry for the corresponding file is updated,
    but leaves the original handle open for subsequent file operations.

    fhandle dw      0               ; file handle
            .
            .
            .

                                    ; now close dup'd handle
            mov     bx,ax           ; put handle into BX

            int     21h             ; transfer to MS-DOS         jc      error

Function 46H (70)
Redirect handle
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Given two handles, makes the second handle refer to the same device or
    file at the same location as the first handle. The second handle is then
    said to be redirected.

Call with:

    AH            = 46H
    BX            = handle for file or device
    CX            = handle to be redirected

Returns:

    If function successful

    Carry flag    = clear

    If function unsuccessful

    Carry flag    = set
    AX            = error code

Notes:

    ■ If the handle passed in CX already refers to an open file, that file is
    closed first.

    ■ A seek, read, or write operation that moves the file pointer for one of
    the two handles also moves the file pointer associated with the other.

    ■ This function is commonly used to redirect the standard input and output
    handles to another file or device before a child process is executed
    with Int 21H Function 4BH.

Example:

    Redirect the standard output to the list device, so that all output
    directed to the console will appear on the printer instead. Later, restore
    the original meaning of the standard output handle.

    stdin   equ     0
    stdout  equ     1
    stderr  equ     2
    stdaux  equ     3

Function 47H (71)
Get current directory
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Obtains an ASCIIZ string that describes the path from the root to the
    current directory, and the name of that directory.

Call with:

    AH            = 47H
    DL            = drive code (0 = default, 1 = A, etc.)
    DS:SI         = segment:offset of 64-byte buffer

Returns:

    If function successful

    Carry flag    = clear

    and buffer is filled in with full pathname from root of current directory.

    If function unsuccessful

    Carry flag    = set
    AX            = error code

Notes:

    ■ The returned path name does not include the drive identifier or a
    leading backslash (\). It is terminated with a null (00H) byte.
    Consequently, if the current directory is the root directory, the first
    byte in the buffer will contain 00H.

    ■ The function fails if the drive code is invalid.

    ■ The current directory may be set with Int 21H Function 3BH.

Example:

    Get the name of the current directory for drive C into the buffer named
    dbuff.

    dbuff   db      64 dup (0)      ; receives path string
            .

Function 48H (72)
Allocate memory block
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Allocates a block of memory and returns a pointer to the beginning of the
    allocated area.

Call with:

    AH            = 48H
    BX            = number of paragraphs of memory needed

Returns:

    If function successful

    Carry flag    = clear
    AX            = base segment address of allocated block

    If function unsuccessful

    Carry flag    = set
    AX            = error code
    BX            = size of largest available block (paragraphs)

Notes:

    ■ If the function succeeds, the base address of the newly allocated block
    is AX:0000.

    ■ The default allocation strategy used by MS-DOS is "first fit"; that is,
    the memory block at the lowest address that is large enough to satisfy
    the request is allocated. The allocation strategy can be altered with
    Int 21H Function 58H.

    ■ When a .COM program is loaded, it ordinarily already "owns" all of the
    memory in the transient program area, leaving none for dynamic
    allocation. The amount of memory initially allocated to a .EXE program
    at load time depends on the MINALLOC and MAXALLOC fields in the .EXE
    file header. See Int 21H Function 4AH.

Example:

    Request a 64 KB block of memory for use as a buffer.

    bufseg  dw      ?               ; segment base of new block
            .
            .

            jc      error           ; jump if allocation failed
            mov     bufseg,ax       ; save segment of new block
            .

Function 49H (73)
Release memory block
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Releases a memory block and makes it available for use by other programs.

Call with:

    AH            = 49H
    ES            = segment of block to be released

Returns:

    If function successful

    Carry flag    = clear

    If function unsuccessful

    Carry flag    = set
    AX            = error code

Notes:

    ■ This function assumes that the memory block being released was
    previously obtained by a successful call to Int 21H Function 48H.

    ■ The function will fail or can cause unpredictable system errors if:

    ∙ the program releases a memory block that does not belong to it.

    ∙ the segment address passed in register ES is not a valid base address
        for an existing memory block.

Example:

    Release the memory block that was previously allocated in the example for
    Int 21H Function 48H (page 438).

    bufseg  dw      ?               ; segment base of block
            .
            .

Function 4AH (74)
Resize memory block
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Dynamically shrinks or extends a memory block, according to the needs of
    an application program.

Call with:

    AH            = 4AH
    BX            = desired new block size in paragraphs
    ES            = segment of block to be modified

Returns:

    If function successful

    Carry flag    = clear

    If function unsuccessful

    Carry flag    = set
    AX            = error code
    BX            = maximum block size available (paragraphs)

Notes:

    ■ This function modifies the size of a memory block that was previously
    allocated with a call to Int 21H Function 48H.

    ■ If the program is requesting an increase in the size of an allocated
    block, and this function fails, the maximum possible size for the
    specified block is returned in register BX. The program can use this
    value to determine whether it should terminate, or continue in a
    degraded fashion with less memory.

    ■ A program that uses EXEC (Int 21H Function 4BH) to load and execute a
    child program must call this function first to make memory available for
    the child, passing the address of its PSP in register ES and the amount
    of memory needed for its own code, data, and stacks in register BX.

Example:

    Resize the memory block that was allocated in the example for Int 21H
    Function 48H (page 438), shrinking it to 32 KB.

    bufseg  dw      ?               ; segment base of block
            .

Function 4BH (75)
Execute program (EXEC)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Allows an application program to run another program, regaining control
    when it is finished. Can also be used to load overlays, although this use
    is uncommon.

Call with:

    AH            = 4BH
    AL            = subfunction
                    00H = Load and Execute Program

    ES:BX         = segment:offset of parameter block
    DS:DX         = segment:offset of ASCIIZ program pathname

Returns:

    If function successful

    Carry flag    = clear

    [2]         all registers except for CS:IP may be destroyed
    [3.0+]      registers are preserved in the usual fashion

    If function unsuccessful

    Carry flag    = set
    AX            = error code

Notes:

    ■ The parameter block format for Subfunction 00H (Load and Execute
    Program) is as follows:

    Bytes       Contents
    00H─01H     segment pointer to environment block
    02H─03H     offset of command line tail
    04H─05H     segment of command line tail
    06H─07H     offset of first FCB to be copied into new PSP + 5CH
    08H─09H     segment of first FCB
    0AH─0BH     offset of second FCB to be copied into new PSP + 6CH
    0CH─0DH     segment of second FCB

    ■ The parameter block format for Subfunction 03H (Load Overlay) is as
    follows:

    Bytes       Contents
    00H─01H     segment address where overlay is to be loaded
    02H─03H     relocation factor to apply to loaded image

    ■ The environment block must be paragraph-aligned. It consists of a
    sequence of ASCIIZ strings in the form:

            db      'COMSPEC=A:\COMMAND.COM',0

    The entire set of strings is terminated by an extra null (00H) byte.

    ■ The command tail format consists of a count byte, followed by an ASCII
    string, terminated by a carriage return (which is not included in the
    count). The first character in the string should be an ASCII space (20H)
    for compatibility with the command tail passed to programs by
    COMMAND.COM. For example:

            db      6,' *.DAT',0dh

    ■ Before a program uses Int 21H Function 4BH to run another program, it
    must release all memory it is not actually using with a call to Int 21H
    Function 4AH, passing the segment address of its own PSP and the number
    of paragraphs to retain.

    ■ Ordinarily, all active handles of the parent program are inherited by
    the child program, although the parent can prevent this in MS-DOS 3.0
    and later by setting the inheritance bit when the file or device is
    opened. Any redirection of the standard input and/or output in the
    parent process also affects the child process.

    ■ The environment block can be used to pass information to the child
    process. If the environment block pointer in the parameter block is
    zero, the child program inherits an exact copy of the parent's
    environment. In any case, the segment address of the child's environment
    is found at offset 002CH in the child's PSP.

    ■ After return from the EXEC function call, the termination type and
    return code of the child program may be obtained with Int 21H Function
    4DH.

Example:

    See Chapter 12.


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Int 21H                                                                [2.0]
Function 4CH (76)
Terminate process with return code
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Terminates the current process, passing a return code to the parent
    process. This is one of several methods that a program can use to perform
    a final exit. MS-DOS then takes the following actions:

    ■ All memory belonging to the process is released.

    ■ File buffers are flushed and any open handles for files or devices owned
    by the process are closed.

    ■ The termination handler vector (Int 22H) is restored from PSP:000AH.

    ■ The Ctrl-C handler vector (Int 23H) is restored from PSP:000EH.

    ■ [2.0+] The critical-error handler vector (Int 24H) is restored from
    PSP:0012H.

    ■ Control is transferred to the termination handler.

    If the program is returning to COMMAND.COM, control transfers to the
    resident portion and the transient portion is reloaded if necessary. If a
    batch file is in progress, the next line of the file is fetched and
    interpreted; otherwise, a prompt is issued for the next user command.

Call with:

    AH            = 4CH
    AL            = return code

Returns:

    Nothing

Notes:

    ■ [2.0+] This is the preferred method of termination for application
    programs because it allows a return code to be passed to the parent
    program and does not rely on the contents of any segment register. Other
    methods of performing a final exit are:

    ∙ Int 20H

    ∙ Int 21H Function 00H

    ∙ Int 21H Function 31H

    ∙ Int 27H

    ■ Any files that have been opened using FCBs and modified by the program
    should be closed before program termination; otherwise, data may be
    lost.

    ■ The return code can be retrieved by the parent process with Int 21H
    Function 4DH (Get Return Code). It can also be tested in a batch file
    with an IF ERRORLEVEL statement. By convention, a return code of zero
    indicates successful execution, and a non-zero return code indicates an
    error.

    ■ [3.0+] If the program is running on a network, it should remove all
    locks it has placed on file regions before terminating.

Example:

    Terminate the current process, passing a return code of 1 to the parent
    process.

            .

Function 4DH (77)
Get return code
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Used by a parent process, after the successful execution of an EXEC call
    (Int 21H Function 4BH), to obtain the return code and termination type of
    a child process.

Call with:

    AH            = 4DH

Returns:

    AH            = exit type
                    00H if normal termination by Int 20H, Int 21H Function
                    00H, or Int 21H Function 4CH
                    01H if termination by user's entry of CtrlDC
                    02H if termination by critical-error handler
                    03H if termination by Int 21H Function 31H or Int 27H
    AL            = return code passed by child process (0 if child terminated
                    by Int 20H, Int 21H Function 00H, or Int 27H)

Notes:

    ■ This function will yield the return code of a child process only once. A
    subsequent call without an intervening EXEC (Int 21H Function 4BH) will
    not necessarily return any valid information.

    ■ This function does not set the carry flag to indicate an error. If no
    previous child process has been executed, the values returned in AL and
    AH are undefined.

Example:

    Get the return code and termination kind of child process that was
    previously executed with Int 21H Function 4BH (EXEC).

    retcode dw      ?               ; return code, termination type
            .

Function 4EH (78)
Find first file
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Given a file specification in the form of an ASCIIZ string, searches the
    default or specified directory on the default or specified drive for the
    first matching file.

Call with:

    AH            = 4EH
    CX            = search attribute (bits may be combined)

                    Bit(s)    Significance (if set)
                    0         read-only
                    1         hidden

                    3         volume label
                    4         directory

                    6─15      reserved (0)

    DS:DX         = segment:offset of ASCIIZ pathname

Returns:

    If function successful (matching file found)

    Carry flag    = clear

    and search results returned in current disk transfer area as follows:

    Byte(s)            Description

                        bits 00H─04H = 2-second increments (0─29)
                        bits 05H─0AH = minutes (0─59)
                        bits 0BH─0FH = hours (0─23)
    18H─19H            file date
                        bits 00H─04H = day (1─31)

    1AH─1DH            file size
    1EH─2AH            ASCIIZ filename and extension

    If function unsuccessful (no matching files)

    Carry flag    = set
    AX            = error code

Notes:

    ■ This function assumes that the DTA has been previously set by the
    program with Int 21H Function 1AH to point to a buffer of adequate
    size.

    ■ The * and ? wildcard characters are allowed in the filename. If wildcard
    characters are present, this function returns only the first matching
    filename.

    ■ If the attribute is 0, only ordinary files are found. If the volume
    label attribute bit is set, only volume labels will be returned (if any
    are present). Any other attribute or combination of attributes (hidden,
    system, and directory) results in those files and all normal files being
    matched.

Example:

    Find the first .COM file in the directory \MYDIR on drive C.

    fname   db      'C:\MYDIR\*.COM',0

    dbuff   db      43 dup (0)      ; receives search results
            .

Function 4FH (79)
Find next file
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Assuming a previous successful call to Int 21H Function 4EH, finds the
    next file in the default or specified directory on the default or
    specified drive that matches the original file specification.

Call with:

    AH            = 4FH

    Assumes DTA points to working buffer used by previous successful Int 21H
    Function 4EH or 4FH.

Returns:

    If function successful (matching file found)

    Carry flag    = clear

    and search results returned in current disk transfer area as described for
    Int 21H Function 4EH

    If function unsuccessful (no more matching files)

    Carry flag    = set
    AX            = error code

Notes:

    ■ Use of this call assumes that the original file specification passed to
    Int 21H Function 4EH contained one or more * or ? wildcard characters.

    ■ When this function is called, the current disk transfer area (DTA) must
    contain information from a previous successful call to Int 21H Function
    4EH or 4FH.

Example:

    Continuing the search operation in the example for Int 21H Function 4EH,
    find the next .COM file (if any) in the directory \MYDIR on drive C.

    fname   db      'C:\MYDIR\*.COM',0

    dbuff   db      43 dup (0)      ; receives search results

Function 54H (84)
Get verify flag
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Obtains the current value of the system verify (read-after-write) flag.

Call with:

    AH            = 54H

Returns:

    AL            = current verify flag value
                    00H if verify off
                    01H if verify on

Notes:

    ■ Because read-after-write verification slows disk operations, the default
    state of the system verify flag is OFF.

    ■ The state of the system verify flag can be changed through a call to Int
    21H Function 2EH or by the MS-DOS commands VERIFY ON and VERIFY OFF.

Example:

    Obtain the state of the system verify flag.

Function 56H (86)
Rename file
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Renames a file and/or moves its directory entry to a different directory
    on the same disk. In MS-DOS version 3.0 and later, this function can also
    be used to rename directories.

Call with:

    AH            = 56H
    DS:DX         = segment:offset of current ASCIIZ pathname
    ES:DI         = segment:offset of new ASCIIZ pathname

Returns:

    If function successful

    Carry flag    = clear

    If function unsuccessful

    Carry flag    = set
    AX            = error code

Notes:

    ■ The function fails if:

    ∙ any element of the pathname does not exist.

    ∙ a file with the new pathname already exists.

    ∙ the current pathname specification contains a different disk drive
        than does the new pathname.

    ∙ the file is being moved to the root directory, and the root directory
        is full.

    ∙ [3.0+] the program is running on a network and the user has
        insufficient access rights to either the existing file or the new
        directory.

    ■ The * and ? wildcard characters are not allowed in either the current or
    new pathname specifications.

Example:

    Change the name of the file MYFILE.DAT in the directory \MYDIR on drive C
    to MYTEXT.DAT. At the same time, move the file to the directory \SYSTEM on
    the same drive.

    oldname db      'C:\MYDIR\MYFILE.DAT',0

                    bits 09H─0FH = year (relative to 1980)

Returns:

    and, if called with AL = 00H

    CX            = time
    DX            = date

    If function unsuccessful

Notes:

    ■ The file must have been previously opened or created via a successful
    call to Int 21H Function 3CH, 3DH, 5AH, 5BH, or 6CH.

    ■ If the 16-bit date for a file is set to zero, that file's date and time
    are not displayed on directory listings.

Function 58H (88)
Get or set allocation strategy
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Obtains or changes the code indicating the current MS-DOS strategy for
    allocating memory blocks.

Call with:

    If getting strategy code

    AH            = 58H
    AL            = 00H

    If setting strategy code

    AH            = 58H
    AL            = 01H
    BX            = desired strategy code

                    00H = first fit
                    01H = best fit
                    02H = last fit

Returns:

    If function successful

    Carry flag    = clear

    and, if called with AL = 00H

    AX            = current strategy code

    If function unsuccessful

    Carry flag    = set
    AX            = error code

Notes:

    ■ The memory allocation strategies are:

    ∙ First fit: MS-DOS searches the available memory blocks from low
        addresses to high addresses, assigning the first one large enough to
        satisfy the block allocation request.

    ∙ Best fit: MS-DOS searches all available memory blocks and assigns the
        smallest available block that will satisfy the request, regardless of
        its position.

    ∙ Last fit: MS-DOS searches the available memory blocks from high
        addresses to low addresses, assigning the highest one large enough to
        satisfy the block allocation request.

    ■ The default MS-DOS memory allocation strategy is First Fit (code 0).

Example:

    Save the code indicating the current memory allocation strategy in the
    variable strat, then change the system's memory allocation strategy to
    "best fit."

    strat   dw      0               ; previous strategy code
            .

            mov     strat,ax        ; save strategy code

                                    ; now set new strategy
            mov     ah,58h          ; function number
            mov     al,1            ; 1 = set strategy

Notes:

    ■ This function may be called after any other Int 21H function call that
    returned an error status, in order to obtain more detailed information
    about the error type and the recommended action. If the previous Int 21H
    function call had no error, 0000H is returned in register AX. This
    function may also be called during the execution of a critical-error
    (Int 24H) handler.

    ■ The contents of registers CL, DX, SI, DI, BP, DS, and ES are destroyed
    by this function.

    ■ Note that extended error codes 13H─1FH (19─31) and 34 (22H) correspond
    exactly to the error codes 0─0CH (0─12) and 0FH (15) returned by Int
    24H.

    ■ You should not code your programs to recognize only specific error
    numbers if you wish to ensure upward compatibility, because new error
    codes are added in each version of MS-DOS.

Example:

    Attempt to open the file named NOSUCH.DAT using a file control block; if
    the open request fails, get the extended error code.

Function 5AH (90)
Create temporary file
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Creates a file with a unique name, in the current or specified directory
    on the default or specified disk drive, and returns a handle that can be
    used by the program for subsequent access to the file. The name generated
    for the file is also returned in a buffer specified by the program.

Call with:

    AH            = 5AH
    CX            = attribute (bits may be combined)

                    Bit(s)    Significance (if set)
                    0         read-only
                    1         hidden
                    2         system
                    3─4       reserved (0)
                    5         archive
                    6─15      reserved (0)

    DS:DX         = segment:offset of ASCIIZ path

Returns:

    If function successful

    Carry flag    = clear
    AX            = handle
    DS:DX         = segment:offset of complete ASCIIZ pathname

    If function unsuccessful

    Carry flag    = set
    AX            = error code

Notes:

    ■ The ASCIIZ path supplied to this function should be followed by at least
    13 additional bytes of buffer space. MS-DOS adds a backslash (\) to the
    supplied path, if necessary, then appends a null-terminated filename
    that is a function of the current time.

    ■ Files created with this function are not automatically deleted when the
    calling program terminates.

    ■ The function fails if

    ∙ any element of the pathname does not exist.

    ∙ the file is being created in the root directory, and the root
        directory is full.

    ■ See also Int 21H Functions 3CH, 5BH, and 6CH, which provide
    additional facilities for creating files.

    ■ [3.0+] If the program is running on a network, the file is created and
    opened for read/write access in compatibility sharing mode.

Example:

    Create a temporary file with a unique name and normal attribute in
    directory \TEMP of drive C. Note that you must allow room for MS-DOS to
    append the generated filename to the supplied path. The complete file
    specification should be used to delete the temporary file before your

Function 5BH (91)
Create new file
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Given an ASCIIZ pathname, creates a file in the designated or default
    directory on the designated or default drive, and returns a handle that
    can be used by the program for subsequent access to the file. If a file
    with the same name already exists, the function fails.

Call with:

    AH            = 5BH
    CX            = attribute (bits may be combined)

                    Bit(s)    Significance (if set)
                    0         read-only

                    5         archive
                    6─15      reserved (0)

    DS:DX         = segment:offset of ASCIIZ pathname

Returns:

    If function successful

    Carry flag    = clear
    AX            = handle

    If function unsuccessful

    Carry flag    = set
    AX            = error code

Notes:

    ■ The function fails if:

    ∙ any element of the specified path does not exist.

    ∙ a file with the identical pathname (i.e., the same filename and
        extension in the same location in the directory structure) already
        exists.

    ∙ the file is being created in the root directory, and the root
        directory is full.

    ∙ [3.0+] the program is running on a network, and the user has
        insufficient access rights to the directory that will contain the
        file.

    ■ The file is usually given a normal attribute (0) when it is created, and
    is opened for both read and write operations. The attribute can
    subsequently be modified with Int 21H Function 43H.

    ■ See also Int 21H Functions 3CH, 5AH, and 6CH, which provide
    alternative ways of creating files.

    ■ This function may be used to implement semaphores in a network or
    multitasking environment. If the function succeeds, the program has
    acquired the semaphore. To release the semaphore, the program simply
    deletes the file.

Example:

    Create and open a file named MYFILE.DAT in the directory \MYDIR on drive
    C; MS-DOS returns an error if a file with the same name already exists in
    that location.

    fname   db      'C:\MYDIR\MYFILE.DAT',0

    fhandle dw      ?               ; file handle
            .
            .
            .

            mov     dx,seg fname    ; filename address
            mov     ds,dx
            mov     dx,offset fname

Function 5CH (92)
Lock or unlock file region
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Locks or unlocks the specified region of a file. This function is not
    available unless the file-sharing module (SHARE.EXE) is loaded.

Call with:

    AH            = 5CH
    AL            = 00H       if locking region
                    01H       if unlocking region

    BX            = handle
    CX            = high part of region offset
    DX            = low part of region offset
    SI            = high part of region length
    DI            = low part of region length

Returns:

    If function successful

    Carry flag    = clear

    If function unsuccessful

    Carry flag    = set
    AX            = error code

Notes:

    ■ This function is useful for file and record synchronization in a
    multitasking environment or network. Access to the file as a whole is
    controlled by the attribute and file-sharing parameters passed in open
    or create calls and by the file's attributes, which are stored in its
    directory entry.

    ■ The beginning location in the file to be locked or unlocked is supplied
    as a positive double precision integer, which is a byte offset into the
    file. The length of the region to be locked or unlocked is similarly
    supplied as a positive double precision integer.

    ■ For every call to lock a region of a file, there must be a subsequent
    unlock call with exactly the same file offset and length.

    ■ Locking beyond the current end of file is not an error.

    ■ Duplicate handles created with Int 21H Function 45H, or handles
    redirected to the file with Int 21H Function 46H, are allowed access to
    locked regions within the same process.

    ■ Programs that are loaded with the EXEC call (Int 21H Function 4BH)
    inherit the handles of their parent but not any active locks.

    ■ If a process terminates without releasing active locks on a file, the
    result is undefined. Therefore, programs using this function should
    install their own Int 23H and Int 24H handlers so that they cannot be
    terminated unexpectedly.

Example:

    Assume that a file was previously opened and that its handle was saved in
    the variable fhandle. Lock a 4096 byte region of the file, starting at
    32,768 bytes from the beginning of the file, so that it cannot be accessed
    by other programs.

    fhandle dw      ?               ; file handle
            .
            .
            .
            mov     ah,5ch          ; function number
            mov     al,0            ; subfunction 0 = lock
            mov     bx,fhandle      ; file handle
            mov     cx,0            ; upper part of offset
            mov     dx,32768        ; lower part of offset
            mov     si,0            ; upper part of length
            mov     di,4096         ; lower part of length
            int     21h             ; transfer to MS-DOS
            jc      error           ; jump if lock failed

Function 5EH (94) Subfunction 00H
Get machine name
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Returns the address of an ASCIIZ (null-terminated) string identifying the
    local computer. This function call is only available when Microsoft
    Networks is running.

Call with:

    AH            = 5EH
    AL            = 00H
    DS:DX         = segment:offset of buffer to receive string

Returns:

    If function unsuccessful

    Carry flag    = set
    AX            = error code

Notes:

    ■ The computer identifier is a 15-byte string, padded with spaces and
    terminated with a null (00H) byte.

    ■ The effect of this call is unpredictable if the file-sharing support
    module is not loaded.

Notes:

    ■ The local name can be a drive designator (a letter followed by a colon,
    such as "D:"), a printer name, or a null string. Printer names must be
    one of the following: PRN, LPT1, LPT2, or LPT3. If a null string
    followed by a password is used, MS-DOS attempts to grant access to the
    network directory with the specified password.

    ■ The parameter passed in CX can be retrieved by later calls to Int 21H
    Function 5FH Subfunction 02H. It represents data that is private to the
    applications which store and retrieve it and has no meaning to MS-DOS.

Function 5FH (95) Subfunction 04H
Cancel device redirection
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Cancels a previous redirection request by removing the association of a
    local device name with a network name. This function call is only
    available when Microsoft Networks is running and the file-sharing module
    (SHARE.EXE) has been loaded.

Call with:

    AH            = 5FH
    AL            = 04H
    DS:SI         = segment:offset of ASCIIZ local device name

Returns:

    If function successful

    Carry flag    = clear

    If function unsuccessful

    Carry flag    = set
    AX            = error code

Note:

    ■ The supplied name can be a drive designator (a letter followed by a
    colon, such as "D:"), a printer name, or a string starting with two
    backslashes (\\). Printer names must be one of the following: PRN, LPT1,
    LPT2, or LPT3. If the string with two backslashes is used, the
    connection between the local machine and the network directory is
    terminated.

Example:

    Cancel the redirection of local drive E to the network server.

    locname db      'E:',0
            .
            .

Function 62H (98)
Get PSP address
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Obtains the segment (paragraph) address of the program segment prefix
    (PSP) for the currently executing program.

Call with:

    AH            = 62H

Returns:

    BX            = segment address of program segment prefix

Notes:

    ■ Before a program receives control from MS-DOS, its program segment
    prefix is set up to contain certain vital information, such as:

    ∙ the segment address of the program's environment block

    ∙ the command line originally entered by the user

    ∙ the original contents of the terminate, Ctrl-C, and critical-error
        handler vectors

    ∙ the top address of available RAM

    ■ The segment address of the PSP is normally passed to the program in
    registers DS and ES when it initially receives control from MS-DOS. This
    function allows a program to conveniently recover the PSP address at any
    point during its execution, without having to save it at program entry.

Example:

    Get the segment base of the program segment prefix, then copy the command
    tail from the PSP into the local buffer named buff.

    ctail   equ     080H            ; PSP offset, command tail

    buff    db      80 dup (?)      ; copy of command tail

Function 63H (99)
Get DBCS lead byte table
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Obtains the address of the system table of legal lead byte ranges for
    double-byte character sets (DBCS), or sets or obtains the interim console
    flag. Int 21H Function 63H is available only in MS-DOS version 2.25; it
    is not supported in MS-DOS versions 3.0 and later.

Call with:

    AH            = 63H
    AL            = subfunction

                    00H       if getting address of DBCS lead byte table
                    01H       if setting or clearing interim console flag
                    02H       if obtaining value of interim console flag

    If AL = 01H

    DL            = 00H       if clearing interim console flag
                    01H       if setting interim console flag

Returns:

    If function successful

    Carry flag    = clear

    and, if called with AL = 00H

    DS:SI         = segment:offset of DBCS lead byte table

    or, if called with AL = 02H

    DL            = value of interim console flag

    If function unsuccessful

    Carry flag    = set
    AX            = error code

Notes:

    ■ The DBCS lead byte table consists of a variable number of two byte
    entries, terminated by two null (00H) bytes. Each pair defines the
    beginning and ending value for a range of lead bytes. The value of a
    legal lead byte is always in the range 80─0FFH.

    ■ Entries in the lead byte table must be in ascending order. If no legal
    lead bytes are defined in a given system, the table consists only of the
    two null bytes.

    ■ If the interim console flag is set, Int 21H Functions 07H (Unfiltered
    Character Input), 08H (Character Input without Echo), and 0BH
    (Keyboard Status) will support interim characters.

    ■ Unlike most other MS-DOS services, this function call does not
    necessarily preserve any registers except SS:SP.

    ■ [4.0] The address of the DBCS lead byte table can also be obtained with
    Int 21H Function 65H.

    ■ The format of the data returned by Subfunctions 02H, 04H, 06H, and 07H
    is:

    Byte(s)        Contents
    00H            information ID code (2, 4, or 6)
    01H─05H        double-word pointer to table

    ■ The uppercase and filename uppercase tables are a maximum of 130 bytes
    long. The first two bytes contain the size of the table; the following
    bytes contain the uppercase equivalents, if any, for character codes
    80H─FFH. The main use of these tables is to map accented or otherwise
    modified vowels to their plain vowel equivalents. Text translated with
    the help of this table can be sent to devices that do not support the
    IBM graphics character set, or used to create filenames that do not
    require a special keyboard configuration for entry.

    ■ The collating table is a maximum of 258 bytes long. The first two bytes
    contain the table length, and the subsequent bytes contain the values to
    be used for the corresponding character codes (0─FFH) during a sort
    operation. This table maps uppercase and lowercase ASCII characters to
    the same collating codes so that sorts will be case-insensitive, and it
    maps accented vowels to their plain vowel equivalents.

    ■ [4.0+] Subfunction 07H returns a pointer to a variable length table of
    that defines ranges for double-byte character set (DBCS) lead bytes. The
    table is terminated by a pair of zero bytes, unless it must be truncated
    to fit in the buffer, and has the following format:

            dw      length
            db      start1,end1
            db      start2,end2
            .
            .
            .
            db      0,0

    For example:

            dw      4
            db      81h,9fh
            db      0e0h,0fch
            db      0,0

    ■ In some cases a truncated translation table may be presented to the
    program by MS-DOS. Applications should always check the length at the
    beginning of the table, to make sure it contains a translation code for
    the particular character of interest.

Examples:

    Obtain the extended country information associated with the default
    country and code page 437.

    buffer  db      41 dup (0)      ; receives country info
            .
            .
            .
            mov     ax,6501h        ; function &amp; subfunction
            mov     bx,437          ; code page
            mov     cx,41           ; buffer length
            mov     dx,-1           ; default country
            mov     di,seg buffer   ; buffer address
            mov     es,di
            mov     di,offset buffer
            int     21h             ; transfer to MS-DOS

            .
            .
            .

    In this case, MS-DOS filled the following extended country information
    into the buffer:

    buffer  db      1               ; info ID code
            dw      38              ; length of following buffer

            db      2               ; digits in currency
            db      0               ; time format
            dd      026ah:176ch     ; case map entry point

            db      10 dup (0)      ; reserved

    Obtain the pointer to the uppercase table associated with the default
    country and code page 437.

    buffer  db      5 dup (0)       ; receives pointer info
            .

            mov     di,seg buffer   ; buffer address
            mov     es,di
            mov     di,offset buffer
            int     21h             ; transfer to MS-DOS

            .
            .
            .

    In this case, MS-DOS filled the following values into the buffer:

            dw      1140h           ; segment of uppercase table

    and the table at 1140:0204H contains the following data:

Function 66H (102)
Get or set code page
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Obtains or selects the current code page.

Call with:

    AL            = subfunction
                    01H = Get Code Page
                    02H = Select Code Page
    BX            = code page to select, if AL = 02H

Returns:

    If function successful

    Carry flag    = clear

    and, if called with AL = 01H

    BX            = active code page
    DX            = default code page

    If function unsuccessful

    Carry flag    = set
    AX            = error code

Note:

    ■ When the Select Code Page subfunction is used, MS-DOS gets the new code
    page from the COUNTRY.SYS file. The device must be previously prepared
    for code page switching with the appropriate DEVICE= directive in the
    CONFIG.SYS file and NLSFUNC and MODE CP PREPARE commands (placed in the
    AUTOEXEC.BAT file, usually).

Example:

    Force the active code page to be the same as the system's default code
    page, that is, restore the code page that was active when the system was
    first booted.

Function 67H (103)
Set handle count
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Sets the maximum number of files and devices that may be opened
    simultaneously using handles by the current process.

Call with:

    AH            = 67H
    BX            = number of desired handles

Returns:

    If function successful

    Carry flag    = clear

    If function unsuccessful

    Carry flag    = set
    AX            = error code

Notes:

    ■ This function call controls the size of the table that relates handle
    numbers for the current process to MS-DOS's internal, global table for
    all of the open files and devices in the system. The default table is
    located in the reserved area of the process's PSP and is large enough
    for 20 handles.

    ■ The function fails if the requested number of handles is greater than 20
    and there is not sufficient free memory in the system to allocate a new
    block to hold the enlarged table.

    ■ If the number of handles requested is larger than the available entries
    in the system's global table for file and device handles (controlled by
    the FILES entry in CONFIG.SYS), no error is returned. However, a
    subsequent attempt to open a file or device, or create a new file, will
    fail if all the entries in the system's global file table are in use,
    even if the requesting process has not used up all its own handles.

Example:

    Set the maximum handle count for the current process to thirty, so that
    the process can have as many as 30 files or devices opened simultaneously.
    (Five of the handles are already assigned to the standard devices when the
    process starts up.) Note that a FILES=30 (or greater value) entry in the
    CONFIG.SYS file would also be required for the process to successfully
    open 30 files or devices.

Function 68H (104)
Commit file
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Forces all data in MS-DOS's internal buffers associated with a specified
    handle to be physically written to the device. If the handle refers to a
    file, and the file has been modified, the time and date stamp and file
    size in the file's directory entry are updated.

Call with:

    AH            = 68H
    BX            = handle

Returns:

    If function successful

    Carry flag    = clear

    If function unsuccessful

    Carry flag    = set
    AX            = error code

Notes:

    ■ The effect of this function is equivalent to closing and reopening a
    file, or to duplicating a handle for the file with Int 21H Function
    45H and then closing the duplicate. However, this function has the
    advantage that it will not fail due to lack of handles, and the
    application does not risk losing control of the file in multitasking or
    network environments.

    ■ If this function is requested for a handle associated with a character
    device, a success flag is returned, but there is no other effect.

Example:

    Assume that the file MYFILE.DAT has been previously opened and that the
    handle for that file is stored in the variable fhandle. Call the Commit
    File function to ensure that any data in MS-DOS's internal buffers
    associated with the handle is written out to disk and that the directory
    and file allocation table are up to date.

    fname   db      'MYFILE.DAT',0  ; ASCIIZ filename
    fhandle dw      ?               ; file handle
            .
            .
            .
            mov     ah,68h          ; function number
            mov     bx,fhandle      ; file handle
            int     21h             ; transfer to MS-DOS
            jc      error           ; jump if commit failed

Notes:

    ■ The function fails if:

    ∙ any element of the pathname does not exist.

    ∙ the file is being created in the root directory and the root directory
        is full.

    ∙ the file is being created and a file with the same name and the
        read-only attribute already exists in the specified directory.

    ∙ the program is running on a network and the user running the program
        has insufficient access rights.

    ■ A file is usually given a normal (0) attribute when it is created. The
    file's attribute can subsequently be modified with Int 21H Function
    43H.

    ■ This function combines the capabilities of Int 21H Functions 3CH, 3DH,
    and 5BH. It was added to MS-DOS for compatibility with the DosOpen
    function of OS/2.

Example:

    Create the file MYFILE.DAT, if it does not already exist, in directory
    \MYDIR on drive C, and save the handle for subsequent access to the file.

    fname   db      'C:\MYDIR\MYFILE.DAT',0

Terminate handler address
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    The machine interrupt vector for Int 22H (memory locations 0000:0088H
    through 0000:008BH) contains the address of the routine that receives
    control when the currently executing program terminates via Int 20H, Int
    27H, or Int 21H Functions 00H, 31H, or 4CH. The address in this vector
    is also copied into offsets 0AH through 0DH of the program segment prefix
    (PSP) when a program is loaded but before it begins executing, and is
    restored from the PSP (in case it was modified by the application) as part
    of MS-DOS's termination handling.

    This interrupt should never be issued directly.


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Int 23H                                                                [1.0]
Ctrl-C handler address
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    The machine interrupt vector for Int 23H (memory locations 0000:008CH
    though 0000:008FH) contains the address of the routine which receives
    control when a Ctrl-C is detected during any character I/O function and,
    if the Break flag is ON, during most other MS-DOS function calls. The
    address in this vector is also copied into locations 0EH through 11H of
    the program segment prefix (PSP) when a program is loaded but before it
    begins executing, and is restored from the PSP (in case it was modified by
    the application) as part of MS-DOS's termination handling.

    This interrupt should never be issued directly.

Notes:

    ■ The initialization code for an application can use Int 21H Function
    25H to reset the Interrupt 23H vector to point to its own routine for
    Ctrl-C handling. In this way, the program can avoid being terminated
    unexpectedly as the result of the user's entry of a Ctrl-C or
    Ctrl-Break.

    ■ When a Ctrl-C is detected and the program's Int 23H handler receives
    control, all registers are set to their values at the point of the
    original function call. The handler can then do any of the following:

    ∙ Set a local flag for later inspection by the application, or take any
        other appropriate action, and perform an IRET. All registers must be
        preserved. The MS-DOS function in progress will be restarted from
        scratch and will proceed to completion, control finally returning to
        the application in the normal manner.

    ∙ Take appropriate action and then perform a RET FAR to give control
        back to MS-DOS. The state of the carry flag is used by MS-DOS to
        determine what action to take. If the carry flag is set, the
        application will be terminated; if the carry flag is clear, the
        application will continue in the normal manner.

    ∙ Retain control by transferring to an error-handling routine within the
        application and then resume execution or take other appropriate
        action, never performing a RET FAR or IRET to end the
        interrupt-handling sequence. This option will cause no harm to the
        system.

    ■ Any MS-DOS function call may be used within the body of an Int 23H
    handler.

Example:

    See Chapter 5.


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Int 24H                                                                [1.0]
Critical-error handler address
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    The machine interrupt vector for Int 24H (memory locations 0000:0090H
    through 0000:0093H) contains the address of the routine that receives
    control when a critical error (usually a hardware error) is detected. This
    address is also copied into locations 12H through 15H of the program
    segment prefix (PSP) when a program is loaded but before it begins
    executing, and is restored from the PSP (in case it was modified by the
    application) as part of MS-DOS's termination handling.

    This interrupt should never be issued directly.

Notes:

    ■ On entry to the critical-error interrupt handler, bit 7 of register AH
    is clear (0) if the error was a disk I/O error; otherwise, it is set
    (1). BP:SI contains the address of a device-driver header from which
    additional information can be obtained. Interrupts are disabled. The
    registers will be set up for a retry operation, and an error code will
    be in the lower half of the DI register, with the upper half undefined.

    The lower byte of DI contains:

    00H            write-protect error
    01H            unknown unit
    02H            drive not ready
    03H            unknown command
    04H            data error (CRC)
    05H            bad request structure length
    06H            seek error
    07H            unknown media type
    08H            sector not found
    09H            printer out of paper
    0AH            write fault
    0BH            read fault
    0CH            general failure
    0DH            reserved
    0EH            reserved
    0FH            invalid disk change (MS-DOS version 3 only)

    Note that these are the same error codes returned by the device driver
    in the request header. Also, upon entry, the stack is set up as shown in
    Figure 8-8, page 149.

    ■ When a disk I/O error occurs, MS-DOS automatically retries the operation
    before issuing a critical-error Int 24H. The number of retries varies
    in different versions of MS-DOS, but is typically in the range three to
    five.

    ■ Int 24H handlers must preserve the SS, SP, DS, ES, BX, CX, and DX
    registers. Only Int 21H Functions 01H─0CH and 59H can be used by an
    Int 24H handler; other function calls will destroy the MS-DOS stack and
    its ability to retry or ignore an error.

    ■ When the Int 24H handler issues an IRET, it should return an action code
    in AL that will be interpreted by DOS as follows:

    0              ignore the error
    1              retry the operation
    2              terminate the program
    3              [3.0+] fail the function call in progress

    ■ If the Int 24H handler returns control directly to the application
    program rather than to MS-DOS, it must restore the program's registers,
    removing all but the last three words from the stack, and issue an IRET.
    Control returns to the instruction immediately following the function
    call that caused the error. This option leaves MS-DOS in an unstable
    state until a call to an Int 21H function higher than Function 0CH is
    made.

Example:

    See Chapter 8.


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Int 25H                                                                [1.0]
Absolute disk read
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Provides a direct linkage to the MS-DOS BIOS module to read data from a
    logical disk sector into memory.

Call with:

    For access to partitions &lt;= 32 MB

    AL            = drive number (0 = A, 1 = B, etc)
    CX            = number of sectors to read
    DX            = starting sector number
    DS:BX         = segment:offset of buffer

    For access to partitions &gt; 32 MB (MS-DOS 4.0 and later)

    AL            = drive number (0 = A, 1 = B, etc)
    CX            = -1
    DS:BX         = segment:offset of parameter block (see Notes)

Returns:

    If function successful

    Carry flag    = clear

    If function unsuccessful

    Carry flag    = set
    AX            = error code (see Notes)

Notes:

    ■ All registers except the segment registers may be destroyed.

    ■ When this function returns, the CPU flags originally pushed on the stack
    by the INT 25H instruction are still on the stack. The stack must be
    cleared by a POPF or ADD SP,2 to prevent uncontrolled stack growth and
    to make accessible any other values that were pushed on the stack before
    the call to INT 25H.

    ■ Logical sector numbers are obtained by numbering each disk sector
    sequentially from cylinder 0, head 0, sector 1, and continuing until the
    last sector on the disk is counted. The head number is incremented
    before the track number. Logically adjacent sectors may not be
    physically adjacent, due to interleaving that occurs at the
    device-adapter level for some disk types.

    ■ The error code is interpreted as follows: The lower byte (AL) is the
    same error code that is returned in the lower byte of DI when an Int 24H
    is issued. The upper byte (AH) contains:

    01H            if bad command
    02H            if bad address mark
    04H            if requested sector not found
    08H            if direct memory access (DMA) failure
    10H            if data error (bad CRC)
    20H            if controller failed
    40H            if seek operation failed
    80H            if attachment failed to respond

    ■ [4.0+] When accessing partitions larger than 32 MB under MS-DOS version
    4, this function uses a parameter block with the following format:

    Bytes          Description
    00H─03H        32-bit sector number
    04H─05H        number of sectors to read
    06H─07H        offset of buffer
    08H─09H        segment of buffer

Example:

    Read logical sector 1 of drive A into the memory area named buff. (On most
    MS-DOS floppy disks, this sector contains the beginning of the file
    allocation table.)

    buff    db      512 dup (?)     ; receives data from disk
            .
            .
            .
            mov     al,0            ; drive A
            mov     cx,1            ; number of sectors
            mov     dx,1            ; beginning sector number

Absolute disk write
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Provides a direct linkage to the MS-DOS BIOS module to write data from
    memory to a logical disk sector.

Call with:

    For access to partitions &lt;= 32 MB

    AL            = drive number (0 = A, 1 = B, etc)
    CX            = number of sectors to write
    DX            = starting sector number
    DS:BX         = segment:offset of buffer

    For access to partitions &gt; 32 MB (MS-DOS 4.0 and later)

    AL            = drive number (0 = A, 1 = B, etc)
    CX            = -1
    DS:BX         = segment:offset of parameter block (see Notes)

Returns:

    If function successful

    Carry flag    = clear

    If function unsuccessful

    Carry flag    = set
    AX            = error code (see Notes)

Notes:

    ■ All registers except the segment registers may be destroyed.

    ■ When this function returns, the CPU flags originally pushed onto the
    stack by the INT 26H instruction are still on the stack. The stack must
    be cleared by a POPF or ADD SP,2 to prevent uncontrolled stack growth
    and to make accessible any other values that were pushed on the stack
    before the call to INT 26H.

    ■ Logical sector numbers are obtained by numbering each disk sector
    sequentially from cylinder 0, head 0, sector 1, and continuing until the
    last sector on the disk is counted. The head number is incremented
    before the track number. Logically adjacent sectors may not be
    physically adjacent, due to interleaving that occurs at the
    device-adapter level for some disk types.

    ■ The error code is interpreted as follows: The lower byte (AL) is the
    same error code that is returned in the lower byte of DI when an Int
    24H is issued. The upper byte (AH) contains:

    01H            if bad command
    02H            if bad address mark
    03H            if write-protect fault
    04H            if requested sector not found
    08H            if direct memory access (DMA) failure
    10H            if data error (bad CRC)
    20H            if controller failed
    40H            if seek operation failed
    80H            if attachment failed to respond

    ■ [4.0+] When accessing partitions larger than 32 MB under MS-DOS version
    4, this function uses a parameter block with the following format:

    Bytes          Description
    00H─03H        32-bit sector number
    04H─05H        number of sectors to read
    06H─07H        offset of buffer
    08H─09H        segment of buffer

Example:

    Write the contents of the memory area named buff into logical sector 3 of
    drive C.

    Warning: Verbatim use of the following code could damage the file system
    on your fixed disk. There is, unfortunately, no way to provide a really
    safe example of this function.

    buff    db      512 dup (?)     ; contains data for write
            .
            .
            .
            mov     al,2            ; drive C
            mov     cx,1            ; number of sectors
            mov     dx,3            ; beginning sector number
            mov     bx,seg buff     ; buffer address
            mov     ds,bx
            mov     bx,offset buff
            int     26h             ; request disk write
            jc      error           ; jump if write failed
            add     sp,2            ; clear stack
            .
            .
            .


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Int 27H                                                                [1.0]
Terminate and stay resident
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Terminates execution of the currently executing program, but reserves part
    or all of its memory so that it will not be overlaid by the next transient
    program to be loaded. MS-DOS then takes the following actions:

    ■ File buffers are flushed and any open handles for files or devices owned
    by the process are closed.

    ■ The termination handler vector (Int 22H) is restored from PSP:000AH.

    ■ The Ctrl-C handler vector (Int 23H) is restored from PSP:000EH.

    ■ [2.0+] The critical-error handler vector (Int 24H) is restored from
    PSP:0012H.

    ■ Control is transferred to the termination handler.

    If the program is returning to COMMAND.COM, control transfers to the
    resident portion and the transient portion is reloaded if necessary. If a
    batch file is in progress, the next line of the file is fetched and
    interpreted; otherwise a prompt is issued for the next user command.

Call with:

    DX            = offset of the last byte plus one (relative to the program
                    segment prefix)
                    of program to be protected
    CS            = segment of program segment prefix

Returns:

    Nothing

Notes:

    ■ This function call is typically used to allow user-written utilities,
    drivers, or interrupt handlers to be loaded as ordinary .COM or .EXE
    programs, then remain resident. Subsequent entrance to the code is via a
    hardware or software interrupt.

    ■ This function attempts to set the initial memory allocation block to the
    length in bytes specified in register DX. If other memory blocks have
    been requested by the application via Int 21H Function 48H, they will
    not be released by this function.

    ■ Other methods of performing a final exit are:

    ∙ Int 20H

    ∙ Int 21H Function 00H

    ∙ Int 21H Function 31H

    ∙ Int 21H Function 4CH

    ■ This function should not be called by .EXE programs that are loaded at
    the high end of the transient program area (i.e., linked with the /HIGH
    switch), because doing so reserves the memory normally used by the
    transient part of COMMAND.COM. If COMMAND.COM cannot be reloaded, the
    system will fail.

    ■ This function does not work correctly when DX contains values in the
    range 0FFF1H─0FFFFH. In this case, MS-DOS discards the high bit of the
    value in DX, resulting in the reservation of 32 KB less memory than was
    requested by the program.

    ■ [2.0+] Int 21H Function 31H should be used in preference to this
    function, because it supports return codes, allows larger amounts of
    memory to be reserved, and does not require CS to contain the segment of
    the program segment prefix.

    ■ [3.0+] If the program is running on a network, it should remove all
    locks it has placed on file regions before terminating.

Example:

    Terminate and stay resident, reserving enough memory to contain the entire
    program.

            .
            .
            .
            mov     dx,offset pend  ; DX = bytes to reserve
            int     27h             ; terminate, stay resident
            .
            .
            .
    pend    equ     $               ; offset, end of program

            end

Multiplex interrupt
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Provides a general-purpose avenue of communication with another process or
    with MS-DOS extensions, such as the print spooler, ASSIGN, SHARE, and
    APPEND. The multiplex number in register AH specifies the process or
    extension being communicated with. The range 00H─BFH is reserved for
    MS-DOS; applications may use the range C0H─FFH.

Int 2FH                                                                [3.0]
Function 01H
Print spooler
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Submits a file to the print spooler, removes a file from the print
    spooler's queue of pending files, or obtains the status of the printer.
    The print spooler, which is contained in the file PRINT.COM, was first
    added to MS-DOS in version 2.0, but the application program interface to
    the spooler was not documented until MS-DOS version 3.

Call with:

    AH            = 01H
    AL            = subfunction
                    00H = Get Installed State
                    01H = Submit File to be Printed
                    02H = Remove File from Print Queue
                    03H = Cancel All Files in Queue
                    04H = Hold Print Jobs for Status Read
                    05H = Release Hold
    DS:DX         = segment:offset of packet (Subfunction 01H)
                    segment:offset of ASCIIZ pathname (Subfunction 02H)

Returns:

    If function successful

    Carry flag    = clear

    and, if called with AL = 00H

    AL            = print spooler state

                    00H       if not installed, ok to install
                    01H       if not installed, not ok to install
                    FFH       if installed

    or, if called with AL = 04H

    DX            = error count
    DS:SI         = segment:offset of print queue file list

    If function unsuccessful

    Carry flag    = set
    AX            = error code

Notes:

    ■ The packet passed to Subfunction 01H consists of five bytes. The first
    byte contains the level, which should be 00H for current versions of
    MS-DOS. The following four bytes contain the segment:offset of an ASCIIZ
    pathname, which may not include wildcard characters. If the specified
    file exists, it is added to the print queue.

    ■ The * and ? wildcard characters may be included in a pathname passed to
    Subfunction 02H, making it possible to delete multiple files from the
    print queue with one call.

    ■ The address returned by Subfunction 04H points to a list of 64-byte
    entries, each containing an ASCIIZ pathname. The first pathname in the
    list is the file currently being printed. The last entry in the list is
    a null string (a single 00H byte).

ASSIGN
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Returns a code indicating whether the resident portion of the ASSIGN
    utility has been loaded.

Call with:

Function 10H (16)
SHARE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Returns a code indicating whether the SHARE.EXE file-sharing module has
    been loaded.

Call with:

    AH            = 10H
    AL            = subfunction

Function B7H (183)
APPEND
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Allows an application to test whether APPEND has been installed. If APPEND
    is resident, returns the APPEND version, state, and the path used to
    search for data files.

Call with:

    AH            = B7H
    AL            = subfunction
                    00H = Get Installed State
                    02H = Get Append Version (4.0)
                    04H = Get Append Path Pointer (4.0)
                    06H = Get Append Function State (4.0)
                    07H = Set Append Function State (4.0)
                    11H = Set Return Found Name State (4.0, see Note)
    BX            = APPEND state (if AL = 07H)

                    Bit(s)    Significance (if set)
                    0         APPEND enabled

    If function unsuccessful

    Carry flag    = set
    AX            = error code

Note:

    ■ If the Return Found Name State is set with Subfunction 11H, the fully
    qualified filename is returned to the next application to call Int 21H
    Function 3DH, 43H, or 6CH. The name is placed at the same address as the
    ASCIIZ parameter string for the Int 21H function, so the application
    must be sure to provide a buffer of adequate size. The Return Found Name
    State is reset after APPEND processes one Int 21H function call.

Notes to the Reader

    In the headers for ROM BIOS video driver (Int 10H) function calls, the
    following icons are used:

    [MDA]                    Monochrome Display Adapter
    [CGA]                    Color/Graphics Adapter
    [PCjr]                   PCjr system board video controller
    [EGA]                    Enhanced Graphics Adapter
    [MCGA]                   Multi-Color Graphics Array (PS/2 Models 25 &amp; 30)
    [VGA]                    Video Graphics Array (PS/2 Models 50 and above)

    In the remainder of this section, the following icons are used:

    [PC]                     Original IBM PC, PC/XT, and PCjr, unless
                            otherwise noted.
    [AT]                     PC/AT and PC/XT-286, unless otherwise noted.
    [PS/2]                   All PS/2 models (including Models 25 and 30),
                            unless otherwise noted.

    ROM BIOS functions that are unique to the PC Convertible have been
    omitted.

    Some functions are supported only in very late revisions of a particular
    machine's ROM BIOS (such as Int 1AH Functions 00H and 01H on the PC/XT).
    In general, such functions are not given an icon for that machine since a
    program could not safely assume that they were available based on the
    machine ID byte(s).

    ■ The presence or absence of color burst is only significant when a
    composite monitor is being used. For RGB monitors, there is no
    functional difference between modes 00H and 01H or modes 02H and 03H. On
    the CGA, two palettes are available in mode 04H and one in mode 05H.

    ■ On the PC/AT, PCjr, and PS/2, if bit 7 of AL is set, the display buffer
    is not cleared when a new mode is selected. On the PC or PC/XT, this
    capability is available only when an EGA or VGA (which have their own
    ROM BIOS) is installed.

Function 01H
Set cursor type
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Selects the starting and ending lines for the blinking hardware cursor in
    text display modes.

Call with:

    AH                 = 01H
    CH bits 0─4        = starting line for cursor
    CL bits 0─4        = ending line for cursor

Returns:

    Nothing

Notes:

    ■ In text display modes, the video hardware causes the cursor to blink,
    and the blink cannot be disabled. In graphics modes, the hardware cursor
    is not available.

    ■ The default values set by the ROM BIOS are:

    Display                        Start     End
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    monochrome mode 07H            11        12
    text modes 00H─03H              6         7
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    ■ On the EGA, MCGA, and VGA in text modes 00H─03H, the ROM BIOS accepts
    cursor start and end values as though the character cell were 8 by 8 and
    remaps the values as appropriate for the true character cell dimensions.
    This mapping is called cursor emulation.

    ■ You can turn off the cursor in several ways. On the MDA, CGA, and VGA,
    setting register CH = 20H causes the cursor to disappear. Techniques
    that involve setting illegal starting and ending lines for the current
    display mode are unreliable. An alternative is to position the cursor to
    a nondisplayable address, such as (x,y)=(0,25).

Function 02H
Set cursor position
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Positions the cursor on the display, using text coordinates.

Call with:

    AH            = 02H
    BH            = page
    DH            = row (y coordinate)
    DL            = column (x coordinate)

Returns:

    Nothing

Notes:

    ■ A separate cursor is maintained for each display page, and each can be
    set independently with this function regardless of the currently active
    page. The number of available display pages depends on the video adapter
    and current display mode. See Int 10H Function 05H.

    ■ Text coordinates (x,y)=(0,0) are the upper left corner of the screen.

    ■ The maximum value for each text coordinate depends on the video adapter
    and current display mode, as follows:

Note:

    ■ A separate cursor is maintained for each display page, and each can be

Get light pen position
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Obtains the current status and position of the light pen.

Call with:

Returns:

    AH            = 00H       if light pen not down/not triggered

    DH            = character row (text y coordinate)
    DL            = character column (text x coordinate)

Notes:

    ■ The range of text and graphics coordinates returned by this function
    depends on the current display mode.

    ■ On the CGA, the graphics coordinates returned by this function are not
    continuous. The y coordinate is always a multiple of two; the x
    coordinate is either a multiple of four (for 320-by-200 graphics modes)
    or a multiple of eight (for 640-by-200 graphics modes).

    ■ Careful selection of background and foreground colors is necessary to
    obtain maximum sensitivity from the light pen across the full screen
    width.

Notes:

    ■ Video mode and adapter combinations not listed above support one display
    page (for example, a Monochrome Adapter in mode 7).

    ■ Switching between pages does not affect their contents. In addition,
    text can be written to any video page with Int 10H Functions 02H, 09H,
    and 0AH, regardless of the page currently being displayed.

    ■ On the PCjr, the CPU page determines the part of the physical memory
    region 00000H─1FFFFH that will be hardware mapped onto 16 KB of memory
    beginning at segment B800H. The CRT page determines the starting address
    of the physical memory used by the video controller to refresh the
    display. Smooth animation effects can be achieved by manipulation of
    these registers. Programs that write directly to the B800H segment can
    reach only the first 16 KB of the video refresh buffer. Programs
    requiring direct access to the entire 32 KB buffer in modes 09H and 0AH
    can obtain the current CRT page from the ROM BIOS variable PAGDAT at
    0040:008AH.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Writes an ASCII character and its attribute to the display at the current
    cursor position.

Call with:

    AH            = 09H
    AL            = character
    BH            = page
    BL            = attribute (text modes) or color (graphics modes)
    CX            = count of characters to write (replication factor)

Returns:

    Nothing

Notes:

    ■ In graphics modes, the replication factor in CX produces a valid result
    only for the current row. If more characters are written than there are
    remaining columns in the current row, the result is unpredictable.

    ■ All values of AL result in some sort of display; control characters,
    including bell, backspace, carriage return, and line feed, are not
    recognized as special characters and do not affect the cursor position.

    ■ After a character is written, the cursor must be moved explicitly with
    Int 10H Function 02H to the next position.

    ■ To write a character without changing the attribute at the current
    cursor position, use Int 10H Function 0AH.

    ■ If this function is used to write characters in graphics mode and bit 7
    of BL is set (1), the character will be exclusive-OR'd (XOR) with the
    current display contents. This feature can be used to write characters
    and then "erase" them.

    ■ For the CGA and PCjr in graphics modes 04H─06H, the bit patterns for
    character codes 80H─FFH are obtained from a table whose address is
    stored in the vector for Int 1FH. On the PCjr, the address of the table
    for character codes 00H─7FH is stored in the vector for Int 44H.
    Alternative character sets may be installed by loading them into memory
    and updating this vector.

    ■ For the EGA, MCGA, and VGA in graphics modes, the address of the
    character definition table is stored in the vector for Int 43H. See Int
    10H Function 11H.

Function 0AH (10)
Write character at cursor
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Writes an ASCII character to the display at the current cursor position.
    The character receives the attribute of the previous character displayed
    at the same position.

Call with:

    AH            = 0AH
    AL            = character
    BH            = page
    BL            = color (graphics modes, PCjr only)
    CX            = count of characters to write (replication factor)

Returns:

    Nothing

Notes:

    ■ In graphics modes, the replication factor in CX produces a valid result
    only for the current row. If more characters are written than there are
    remaining columns in the current row, the result is unpredictable.

    ■ All values of AL result in some sort of display; control characters,
    including bell, backspace, carriage return, and line feed, are not
    recognized as special characters and do not affect the cursor position.

    ■ After a character is written, the cursor must be moved explicitly with
    Int 10H Function 02H to the next position.

    ■ To write a character and attribute at the current cursor position, use
    Int 10H Function 09H.

    ■ If this function is used to write characters in graphics mode and bit 7
    of BL is set (1), the character will be exclusive-OR'd (XOR) with the
    current display contents. This feature can be used to write characters
    and then "erase" them.

    ■ For the CGA and PCjr in graphics modes 04H─06H, the bit patterns for
    character codes 80H─FFH are obtained from a table whose address is
    stored in the vector for Int 1FH. On the PCjr, the address of the table
    for character codes 00H─7FH is stored in the vector for Int 44H.
    Alternative character sets may be installed by loading them into memory
    and updating this vector.

    ■ For the EGA, MCGA, and VGA in graphics modes, the address of the
    character definition table is stored in the vector for Int 43H. See Int
    10H Function 11H.

Function 0BH (11)
Set palette, background, or border
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Selects a palette, background, or border color.

Call with:

    To set the background color and border color for graphics modes or the
    border color for text modes

    AH            = 0BH
    BH            = 00H
    BL            = color

    To select the palette (320-by-200 4-color graphics modes)

    AH            = 0BH
    BH            = 01H
    BL            = palette (see Notes)

Returns:

    Nothing

Notes:

    ■ In text modes, this function selects only the border color. The
    background color of each individual character is controlled by the upper
    4 bits of that character's attribute byte.

    ■ On the CGA and EGA, this function is valid for palette selection only in
    320-by-200 4-color graphics modes.

    ■ In 320-by-200 4-color graphics modes, if register BH = 01H, the
    following palettes may be selected:

    Palette           Pixel value       Color
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    0                 0                 same as background
                        1                 green
                        2                 red
                        3                 brown or yellow
    1                 0                 same as background
                        1                 cyan
                        2                 magenta
                        3                 white
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    ■ On the CGA in 640-by-200 2-color graphics mode, the background color
    selected with this function actually controls the display color for
    nonzero pixels; zero pixels are always displayed as black.

    ■ On the PCjr in 640-by-200 2-color graphics mode, if BH = 00H and bit 0
    of register BL is cleared, pixel value 1 is displayed as white; if bit 0
    is set, pixel value 1 is displayed as black.

    the PCjr, EGA, MCGA, and VGA.

Function 0CH (12)
Write graphics pixel
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Draws a point on the display at the specified graphics coordinates.

Call with:

    AH            = 0CH
    AL            = pixel value
    BH            = page
    CX            = column (graphics x coordinate)
    DX            = row (graphics y coordinate)

Returns:

    Nothing

Notes:

    ■ The range of valid pixel values and (x,y) coordinates depends on the
    current video mode.

    ■ If bit 7 of AL is set, the new pixel value will be exclusive-OR'd (XOR)
    with the current contents of the pixel.

    ■ Register BH is ignored for display modes that support only one page.

Function 0DH (13)
Read graphics pixel
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Obtains the current value of the pixel on the display at the specified
    graphics coordinates.

Call with:

Function 0EH (14)
Write character in teletype mode
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Writes an ASCII character to the display at the current cursor position,
    using the specified color (if in graphics modes), and then increments the
    cursor position appropriately.

Call with:

    AH            = 0EH
    AL            = character
    BH            = page
    BL            = foreground color (graphics modes)

Returns:

    Nothing

Notes:

    ■ The special ASCII codes for bell (07H), backspace (08H), carriage return
    (0DH), and line feed (0AH) are recognized, and the appropriate action is
    taken. All other characters are written to the display (even if they are
    control characters), and the cursor is moved to the next position.

    ■ In video modes that support multiple pages, characters can be written to
    any page, regardless of the page currently being displayed.

    ■ Line wrapping and scrolling are provided. If the cursor is at the end of
    a line, it is moved to the beginning of the next line. If the cursor
    reaches the end of the last line on the screen, the screen is scrolled
    up by one line and the cursor is placed at the beginning of a new blank
    line. The attribute for the entire new line is taken from the last
    character that was written on the preceding line.

    ■ The default MS-DOS console driver (CON) uses this function to write text
    to the screen. You cannot use this function to specify the attribute of
    a character. One method of writing a character to the screen with a
    specific attribute is to first write an ASCII blank (20H) with the
    desired attribute at the current cursor location using Int 10H Function
    09H and then write the actual character with Int 10H Function 0EH.
    This technique, although somewhat clumsy, does not require the program
    to explicitly handle line wrapping and scrolling.

    ■ See also Int 10H Function 13H.

Notes:

    ■ The color list is 17 bytes long. The first 16 bytes are the color values
    to be loaded into palette registers 0─15, and the last byte is stored in
    the border color register.

    ■ In 16-color graphics modes, the following default palette is set up:

    AL            = 03H
    BL            = character generator block select code (see Notes)

Returns:

Notes:

    ■ On the EGA and MCGA, the bits of BL are used as follows:

    Bits      Significance
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    0─1       character block selected by attribute bytes with bit 3 = 0
    2─3       character block selected by attribute bytes with bit 3 = 1

    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    0,1,4     character block selected by attribute bytes with bit 3 = 0
    2,3,5     character block selected by attribute bytes with bit 3 = 1
    6─7       not used (should be 0)
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    ■ When using a 256-character set, both fields of BL should select the same
    character block. In such cases, character attribute bit 3 controls the
    foreground intensity. When using 512-character sets, the fields of BL
    designate the blocks holding each half of the character set, and bit 3
    of the character attribute selects the upper or lower half of the
    character set.

    ■ When using a 512-character set, a call to Int 10H Function 10H

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Saves or restores the digital-to-analog converter (DAC) state and color

    ES:BX         = segment:offset of buffer

Returns:

    AL            = 1CH

    and, if called with AL = 00H

    BX            = buffer block count (64 bytes per block)

    or, if called with AL = 01H

    State information placed in caller's buffer

    or, if called with AL = 02H

    Requested state restored according to contents of caller's buffer

Notes:

    ■ Subfunction 00H is used to determine the size of buffer that will be
    necessary to contain the specified state information. The caller must
    supply the buffer.

    ■ The current video state is altered during a save state operation (AL =
    01H). If the requesting program needs to continue in the same video
    state, it can follow the save state request with an immediate call to
    restore the video state.

    ■ This function is supported on the VGA only.

Notes:

    ■ On some early PC models, the amount of memory returned by this function
    is controlled by the settings of the dip switches on the system board
    and may not reflect all the memory that is physically present.

    ■ On the PC/AT, the value returned is the amount of functional memory
    found during the power-on self-test, regardless of the memory size
    configuration information stored in CMOS RAM.

    ■ The value returned does not reflect any extended memory (above the 1 MB
    boundary) that may be installed on 80286 or 80386 machines such as the
    PC/AT or PS/2 (Models 50 and above).

    If function unsuccessful

    Carry flag    = set
    AH            = status (see Int 13H Function 01H)

Notes:

    ■ On fixed disks, the upper 2 bits of the 10-bit cylinder number are
    placed in the upper 2 bits of register CL.

    ■ On fixed disks, error code 11H indicates that a read error occurred that
    was corrected by the ECC algorithm; in this event, register AL contains
    the burst length. The data returned is probably good, although there is
    a small chance that the data was not corrected properly. If a
    multi-sector transfer was requested, the operation was terminated after
    the sector containing the read error.

    ■ On floppy disk drives, an error may result from the drive motor being
    off at the time of the request. The ROM BIOS does not automatically wait
    for the drive to come up to speed before attempting the read operation.
    The requesting program should reset the floppy disk system (Int 13H
    Function 00H) and retry the operation three times before assuming that
    the error results from some other cause.

    ■ On floppy disk drives, an error may result from the drive motor being
    off at the time of the request. The ROM BIOS does not automatically wait
    for the drive to come up to speed before attempting the write operation.

Function 04H
Verify sector
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Verifies the address fields of one or more sectors. No data is transferred
    to or from memory by this operation.

Call with:

    AH            = 04H
    AL            = number of sectors
    CH            = cylinder
    CL            = sector

                    80H─FFH   fixed disk

    ES:BX         = segment:offset of buffer (see Notes)

Returns:

    If function successful

    Carry flag    = clear
    AH            = 00H
    AL            = number of sectors verified

    If function unsuccessful

    Carry flag    = set
    AH            = status (see Int 13H Function 01H)

Notes:

    ■ On PCs, PC/XTs, and PC/ATs with ROM BIOS dated earlier than 11/15/85,
    ES:BX should point to a valid buffer.

    ■ On fixed disks, the upper 2 bits of the 10-bit cylinder number are
    placed in the upper 2 bits of register CL.

    ■ This function can be used to test whether a readable media is in a
    floppy disk drive. An error may result from the drive motor being off at
    the time of the request, because the ROM BIOS does not automatically
    wait for the drive to come up to speed before attempting the verify
    operation. The requesting program should reset the floppy disk system
    (Int 13H Function 00H) and retry the operation three times before
    assuming that a readable floppy disk is not present.

Function 05H
Format track
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Initializes disk sector and track address fields on the specified track.

Call with:

    AH            = 05H
    AL            = interleave (PC/XT fixed disks)

    ES:BX         = segment:offset of address field list (except PC/XT fixed
                    disk, see Note)

Returns:

    If function successful

    Carry flag    = clear
    AH            = 00H

    If function unsuccessful

    Carry flag    = set
    AH            = status (see Int 13H Function 01H)

Notes:

    ■ On floppy disks, the address field list consists of a series of 4-byte
    entries, one entry per sector, in the following format:

    Byte(s)     Contents
    0           cylinder
    1           head
    2           sector
    3           sector-size code

                00H         if 128 bytes per sector
                01H         if 256 bytes per sector
                02H         if 512 bytes per sector (standard)
                03H         if 1024 bytes per sector

    ■ On floppy disks, the number of sectors per track is taken from the BIOS
    floppy disk parameter table whose address is stored in the vector for
    Int 1EH.

    ■ When this function is used for floppy disks on the PC/AT or PS/2, it
    should be preceded by a call to Int 13H Function 17H to select the type
    of medium to be formatted.

    ■ On fixed disks, the upper 2 bits of the 10-bit cylinder number are
    placed in the upper 2 bits of register CL.

    ■ On PC/XT-286, PC/AT, and PS/2 fixed disks, ES:BX points to a 512-byte
    buffer containing byte pairs for each physical disk sector, as follows:

    Byte(s)     Contents
    0           00H for good sector
                80H for bad sector
    1           sector number

    For example, to format a track with 17 sectors and an interleave of two,
    ES:BX would point to the following 34-byte array at the beginning of a
    512-byte buffer:

    db      00h,01h,00h,0ah,00h,02h,00h,0bh,00h,03h,00h,0ch
    db      00h,04h,00h,0dh,00h,05h,00h,0eh,00h,06h,00h,0fh

Function 06H
Format bad track
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Initializes a track, writing disk address fields and data sectors and
    setting bad sector flags.

Call with:

Notes:

    ■ This operation is sometimes called a "low level format" and prepares the
    disk for physical read/write operations at the sector level. The drive
    must be subsequently partitioned with the FDISK command and then given a
    "high level format" with the FORMAT command to install a file system.

    ■ If bit 4 of register CL is set, Int 15H is called with AH = 0FH and AL
    = phase code after each cylinder is formatted or analyzed. The phase
    code is defined as:

    0 = reserved
    1 = surface analysis
    2 = formatting

    See also Int 15H Function 0FH.

    ■ If bit 2 of register CL is set, the drive's secondary defect map is
    updated to reflect errors found during surface analysis. If both bit 2
    and bit 1 are set, the secondary defect map is replaced.

    ■ For an extended surface analysis, the disk should first be formatted by
    calling this function with bit 3 cleared, then analyzed by calling this
    function with bit 3 set.

Function 83H (131)
Event wait
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Requests setting of a semaphore after a specified interval or cancels a

Call with:

    If requesting event wait

    AH            = 83H
    AL            = 00H
    CX:DX         = microseconds

    If called with AL = 00H, and function unsuccessful (Event Wait already
    active)

    Carry flag    = set

    If called with AL = 01H

    Nothing

Notes:

    ■ The function call returns immediately. If the function is successful,
    bit 7 of the semaphore byte is set when the specified interval has
    elapsed. The calling program is responsible for clearing the semaphore
    before requesting this function.

    ■ The actual duration of an event wait is always an integral multiple of
    976 microseconds. The CMOS date/clock chip interrupts are used to
    implement this function.

    ■ Use of this function allows programmed, hardware-independent delays at a
    finer resolution than can be obtained through use of the MS-DOS Get Time
    function (Int 21H Function 2CH, which returns time in hundredths of a
    second).

    ■ See also Int 15H Function 86H, which suspends the calling program for
    the specified interval in milliseconds.

    ■ This function is not supported on the PS/2 Models 25 and 30.

    subfunction number.

    ■ If no game adapter is installed, AL is returned as 00H for Subfunction
    00H (i.e., all switches open); AX, BX, CX, and DX are returned
    containing 00H for Subfunction 01H.

    ■ Using a 250 KOhm joystick, the potentiometer values usually lie within
    the srange 0─416 (0000─01A0H).

    used for the execution of MS-DOS and its application programs. Extended
    memory lies at addresses above 1 MB, and can only be accessed by an
    80286 or 80386 CPU running in protected mode. As much as 15 MB of
    extended memory can be installed in an IBM PC/AT or compatible.

    ■ The Global Descriptor Table (GDT) used by this function must be set up
    as follows:

    Byte(s)     Contents
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    00H─0FH     reserved (should be 0)
    10H─11H     segment length in bytes (2*CX - 1 or greater)
    12H─14H     24-bit source address
    15H         access rights byte (always 93H)
    16H─17H     reserved (should be 0)
    18H─19H     segment length in bytes (2*CX - 1 or greater)
    1AH─1CH     24-bit destination address
    1DH         access rights byte (always 93H)
    1EH─2FH     reserved (should be 0)
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    The table is composed of six 8-byte descriptors to be used by the CPU in
    protected mode. The four descriptors in offsets 00H─0FH and 20H─2FH are
    filled in by the ROM BIOS before the CPU mode switch.

    ■ The addresses used in the descriptor table are linear (physical) 24-bit
    addresses in the range 000000H─FFFFFFH──not segments and offsets──with
    the least significant byte at the lowest address and the most
    significant byte at the highest address.

    ■ The block move is performed with interrupts disabled; thus, use of this
    function may interfere with the operation of communications programs,
    network drivers, or other software that relies on prompt servicing of
    hardware interrupts.

    ■ Programs and drivers that access extended memory with this function
    cannot be executed in the Compatibility Environment of OS/2.

    ■ This function is not supported on the PS/2 Models 25 and 30.

Function 88H (136)
Get extended memory size
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Returns the amount of extended memory installed in the system.

Call with:

    AH            = 88H

Returns:

    AX            = amount of extended memory (in KB)

Notes:

    ■ Extended memory is memory at addresses above 1 MB, which can only be
    accessed by an 80286 or 80386 CPU running in protected mode. Because
    MS-DOS is a real-mode operating system, extended memory can be used for
    storage of volatile data but cannot be used for execution of programs.

    ■ Programs and drivers that use this function cannot be executed in the
    Compatibility Environment of OS/2.

    ■ This function is not supported on the PS/2 Models 25 and 30.

Function 89H (137)
Enter protected mode
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Switches the CPU from real mode into protected mode.

Call with:

    AH            = 89H
    BH            = interrupt number for IRQ0, written to ICW2 of 8259 PIC #1

                    (must be evenly divisible by 8, determines IRQ8─IRQ15)
    ES:SI         = segment:offset of Global Descriptor Table (GDT)

Returns:

    If function unsuccessful (CPU is in real mode)

    Carry flag    = set
    AH            = FFH

Notes:

    ■ The Global Descriptor Table must contain eight descriptors set up as
    follows:

    Offset      Descriptor usage
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    00H         dummy descriptor (initialized to 0)
    08H         Global Descriptor Table (GDT)

    28H         user's stack segment (SS)
    30H         user's code segment (CS)
    38H         BIOS code segment
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    The user must initialize the first seven descriptors; the eighth is
    filled in by the ROM BIOS to provide addressability for its own
    execution. The calling program may modify and use the eighth descriptor
    for any purpose after return from this function call.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Invoked by the ROM BIOS fixed disk, floppy disk, printer, network, and
    keyboard drivers prior to performing a programmed wait for I/O completion.

Call with:

    AH            = 90H
    AL            = device type

                    00H─7FH   serially reusable devices

                    C0H─FFH   wait-only calls, no corresponding Post function

    ES:BX         = segment:offset of request block for device types 80H─FFH

Returns:

    If no wait (driver must perform its own time-out)

    Carry flag    = clear
    AH            = 00H

    If wait was performed

    Carry flag    = set

Notes:

    80H         network (no time-out)
    FCH         fixed disk reset (PS/2, may time-out)
    FDH         floppy disk drive motor start (may time-out)
    FEH         printer (may time-out)

    ■ For network adapters, ES:BX points to a network control block (NCB).

    ■ A multitasking program manager would be expected to capture Int 15H
    Function 90H so that it can dispatch other tasks while I/O is in
    progress. The default BIOS routine for this function simply returns with
    the carry flag clear and AH = 00H.

Function 91H (145)
Device post
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Invoked by the ROM BIOS fixed disk, floppy disk, network, and keyboard
    drivers to signal that I/O is complete and/or the device is ready.

Call with:

    AH            = 91H

    03H         pointing device (PS/2, may time-out)
    80H         network (no time-out)

    ■ The ROM BIOS printer routine does not invoke this function because
    printer output is not interrupt driven.

    ■ A multitasking program manager would be expected to capture Int 15H
    Function 91H so that it can be notified when I/O is completed and
    awaken the requesting task. The default BIOS routine for this function
    simply returns with the carry flag clear and AH = 00H.

Int 33H
Microsoft Mouse driver
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    The Microsoft Mouse driver makes its functions available to application
    programs via Int 33H. These functions have become a de facto standard for
    pointer device drivers of all varieties. Unlike the other function calls
    described in this section, the Microsoft Mouse driver is not part of the
    ROM BIOS but is loaded by a DEVICE= directive in the CONFIG.SYS file. All
    mouse-function information applies to the Microsoft Mouse driver version
    6. Earlier versions of the driver may not support all of these functions.


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Int 33H
Function 00H
Reset mouse and get status
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Initializes the mouse driver and returns the driver status. If the mouse
    pointer was previously visible, it is removed from the screen, and any
    previously installed user handlers for mouse events are disabled.

Call with:

    AX            = 0000H

Returns:

    If mouse support is available

    AX            = FFFFH
    BX            = number of mouse buttons

    If mouse support is not available

    AX            = 0000H

Note:

    ■ After a call to this function, the mouse driver is initialized to the
    following state:

    ∙ Mouse pointer at screen center (see Int 33H Functions 03H and 04H)

    ∙ Display page for mouse pointer set to zero (see Int 33H Functions
        1DH and 1EH)

    ∙ Mouse pointer hidden (see Int 33H Functions 01H, 02H, and 10H)

    ∙ Mouse pointer set to default arrow shape in graphics modes, or reverse
        block in text modes (see Int 33H Functions 09H and 0AH)

    ∙ User mouse event handler disabled (see Int 33H Functions 0CH and
        14H)

    ∙ Light pen emulation enabled (see Int 33H Functions 0DH and 0EH)

    ∙ Horizontal mickeys to pixels ratio at 8 to 8, vertical ratio at 16 to
        8 (see Int 33H Function 0FH)

    ∙ Double speed threshold set to 64 mickeys/second (see Int 33H Function
        19H)

    ∙ Minimum and maximum horizontal and vertical pointer position limits
        set to include the entire screen in the current display mode (see Int
        33H Functions 07H and 08H)


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Int 33H
Function 01H
Show mouse pointer
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Displays the mouse pointer, and cancels any mouse pointer exclusion area
    previously defined with Int 33H Function 10H.

Call with:

    AX            = 0001H

Returns:

    Nothing

Note:

    ■ A counter is maintained which is decremented by calls to Int 33H
    Function 02H (Hide Mouse Pointer) and incremented (if nonzero) by this
    function. When the counter is zero or becomes zero, the mouse pointer is
    displayed. When the mouse driver is reset with Int 33H Function 00H,
    the counter is forced to -1.


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Int 33H
Function 02H
Hide mouse pointer
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Removes the mouse pointer from the display. The driver continues to track
    the mouse position.

Call with:

    AX            = 0002H

Returns:

    Nothing

Note:

    ■ A counter is maintained which is decremented by calls to this function
    and incremented (if nonzero) by Int 33H Function 01H (Show Mouse
    Pointer). When the counter is zero, the mouse pointer is displayed. When
    the mouse driver is reset with Int 33H Function 00H, the counter is
    forced to -1.

    CX            = horizontal (X) coordinate
    DX            = vertical (Y) coordinate

Note:

    ■ Coordinates are returned in pixels regardless of the current display
    mode. Position (x,y) = (0,0) is the upper left corner of the screen.


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Int 33H
Function 04H
Set mouse pointer position
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Sets the position of the mouse pointer. The pointer is displayed at the
    new position unless it has been hidden with Int 33H Function 02H, or the
    new position lies within an exclusion area defined with Int 33H Function
    10H.

Call with:

    AX            = 0004H
    CX            = horizontal (X) coordinate
    DX            = vertical (Y) coordinate

Returns:

    Nothing

Notes:

    ■ Coordinates are specified in pixels regardless of the current display
    mode. Position (x,y) = (0,0) is the upper left corner of the screen.

    ■ The position is adjusted if necessary to lie within the horizontal and
    vertical limits specified with a previous call to Int 33H Functions
    07H and 08H.


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Int 33H
Function 05H
Get button press information
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Returns the current status of all mouse buttons, and the number of presses
    and position of the last press for a specified mouse button since the last

    and each pixel offset must be in the range -16 through 16. In display
    modes 4 and 5, the horizontal offset must be an even number.


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Int 33H
Function 0AH (10)
Set text pointer type
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Defines the shape and attributes of the mouse pointer in text modes.

Call with:

    AX            = 000AH
    BX            = pointer type

                    0 =       software cursor
                    1 =       hardware cursor

    CX            = AND mask value (if BX = 0) or
                    starting line for cursor (if BX = 1)
    DX            = XOR mask value (if BX = 0) or
                    ending line for cursor (if BX = 1)

Returns:

    Nothing

Notes:

    ■ If the software text cursor is selected (BX = 0), the masks in CX and DX
    are mapped as follows:

    Bit(s)      Significance
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    0─7         character code
    8─10        foreground color
    11          intensity
    12─14       background color
    15          blink
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    For example, the following values would yield a software mouse cursor
    that inverts the foreground and background colors:

    AX          = 000AH
    BX          = 0000H
    CX          = 77FFH
    DX          = 7700H

    ■ When the hardware text cursor is selected (BX = 1), the values in CX and
    DX are the starting and ending scan lines for the blinking cursor
    generated by the video adapter. The maximum scan line which may be used
    depends on the type of adapter and the current display mode.

    upwards. One mickey represents approximately 1/200 of an inch of mouse
    movement.

Call with:

    AX            = 000BH

Returns:

    CX            = horizontal (X) mickey count
    DX            = vertical (Y) mickey count


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Int 33H
Function 0CH (12)

                    1         left button pressed
                    2         left button released
                    3         right button pressed
                    4         right button released
                    5         center button pressed
                    6         center button released
                    7─15      reserved (0)

    ES:DX         = segment:offset of handler

Returns:

    Nothing

Notes:

    ■ The user-defined event handler is entered from the mouse driver by a far
    call with registers set up as follows:

    AX             mouse event flags (see event mask)
    BX             button state

                    Bit(s)     Significance (if set)

    DI             last raw horizontal mickey count
    DS             mouse driver data segment

    ■ If an event does not generate a call to the user-defined handler because
    its bit is not set in the event mask, it is still reported in the event
    flags during calls to the handler for events which are enabled.

    ■ Calls to the handler are disabled with Int 33H Function 00H or by
    calling this function with an event mask of zero.

Notes to the Reader

    The Lotus/Intel/Microsoft Expanded Memory Specification (EMS) defines a
    hardware/software subsystem, compatible with 80x86-based microcomputers
    running MS-DOS, that allows applications to access as much as 32 MB of
    bank-switched random-access memory. The software component, called the
    Expanded Memory Manager (EMM), is installed during system initialization
    by a DEVICE= directive in the CONFIG.SYS file in the root directory on the
    boot disk.

    After ensuring that the EMM is present (see Chapter 11), an application
    program communicates directly with the EMM using software interrupt 67H. A
    particular EMM function is selected by the value in register AH and a
    success or error status is returned in register AH (error codes are listed
    on pages 207─209). Other parameters and results are passed or returned in
    registers or buffers.

    An icon in each function heading indicates the EMS version in which that
    function was first supported. You can assume that the function is
    available in all subsequent EMS versions unless explicitly noted
    otherwise.

    Version icons used in the synopsis, parameters, results, or Notes section
    refer to specific minor or major EMS versions, unless they include a +
    sign to indicate a version and all subsequent versions.

    The material in this section has been verified against the Expanded Memory
    Specification version 4.0, dated October 1987, Intel part number
    300275-005. This document can be obtained from Intel Corporation, 5200

Function 40H (64)
Get status
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Returns a status code indicating whether the expanded memory software and
    hardware are present and functional.

Call with:

    AH            = 40H

Returns:

    If function successful

    AH            = 00H

    If function unsuccessful

    AH            = error code

Note:

    ■ This call should be used only after an application has established that
    the Expanded Memory Manager is in fact present, using one of the
    techniques described in Chapter 11.


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Int 67H                                                            [EMS 3.0]
Function 41H (65)
Get page frame address
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Returns the segment address of the page frame used by the Expanded Memory
    Manager.

Call with:

    AH            = 41H

Returns:

    If function successful

    AH            = 00H
    BX            = segment base of page frame

    If function unsuccessful

    AH            = error code

Notes:

    ■ The page frame is divided into four 16 KB pages, which are used to map
    logical expanded memory pages into the physical memory space of the CPU.

    ■ The application need not have already acquired an EMM handle to use this
    function.

    ■ [EMS 4.0] Mapping of expanded memory pages is not necessarily limited to
    the 64 KB page frame. See also Int 67H Function 58H Subfunction 00H.

Function 42H (66)
Get number of pages
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Obtains the total number of logical expanded memory pages present in the
    system and the number of pages that are not already allocated.

Call with:

    AH            = 42H

Returns:

    If function successful

    AH            = 00H
    BX            = unallocated pages
    DX            = total pages

    If function unsuccessful

    AH            = error code

Notes:

    ■ The application need not have already acquired an EMM handle to use this
    function.

    ■ [EMS 4.0] See also Int 67H Function 59H Subfunction 01H.


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Int 67H                                                            [EMS 3.0]
Function 43H (67)
Allocate handle and pages
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Obtains an EMM handle and allocates logical pages of expanded memory to be
    controlled by that handle.

Call with:

    AH            = 43H
    BX            = number of pages to allocate (must be nonzero)

Returns:

    If function successful

    AH            = 00H
    DX            = EMM handle

    If function unsuccessful

    AH            = error code

Notes:

    ■ This is the equivalent of a file open function for the expanded memory
    manager. The handle that is returned is analogous to a file handle and
    owns a certain number of expanded memory pages. The handle must be used
    with every subsequent request to map memory and must be released by a
    close operation before the application terminates.

    ■ This function may fail because there are no handles left to allocate or
    because there is an insufficient number of expanded memory pages to
    satisfy the request. In the latter case, Int 67H Function 42H can be
    used to determine the actual number of pages available.

    ■ [EMS 4.0] Int 67H Function 51H can be called to change the number of
    pages allocated to an EMM handle.

    ■ [EMS 4.0] The pages allocated by this function are always 16 KB for
    compatibility with earlier versions of EMS. See also Int 67H Function
    5AH Subfunctions 00H and 01H.

    ■ [EMS 4.0] Handle 0000H is always available for use by the operating
    system, and a prior call to this function is not required. The operating
    system must call Int 67H Function 51H to assign the desired number of
    pages to its reserved handle.

Int 67H                                                            [EMS 3.0]
Function 44H (68)
Map expanded memory page
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Maps one of the logical pages of expanded memory assigned to a handle onto
    a physical memory page that can be accessed by the CPU.

Call with:

    AH            = 44H
    AL            = physical page
    BX            = logical page
    DX            = EMM handle

Returns:

    If function successful

    AH            = 00H

    If function unsuccessful

    AH            = error code

Notes:

    ■ The logical page number is in the range {0...n-1}, where n is the number
    of pages allocated or reallocated to the handle by a previous call to
    Int 67H Function 43H, 51H, or 5AH. Logical pages allocated by Int 67H
    Function 43H or Function 5AH Subfunction 00H are always 16 KB long;
    logical pages allocated by Int 67H Function 5AH Subfunction 01H are
    referred to as raw pages and are not necessarily 16 KB.

    ■ [EMS 3] The physical page is in the range 0─3 and lies within the EMM
    page frame, whose base address is obtained from Int 67H Function 41H.

    ■ [EMS 4.0] A list of the available physical pages and their addresses may
    be obtained from Int 67H Function 58H Subfunction 00H.

    ■ [EMS 4.0] If this function is called with BX = -1, the specified
    physical page is unmapped (made inaccessible for reading or writing).


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Int 67H                                                            [EMS 3.0]
Function 45H (69)
Release handle and expanded memory
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Deallocates the expanded memory pages assigned to a handle and then
    releases the handle.

Call with:

    AH            = 45H
    DX            = EMM handle

Returns:

    If function successful

    AH            = 00H

    If function unsuccessful

    AH            = error code

Notes:

    ■ If this function is not called before a program terminates, the EMS
    pages it owned remain unavailable until the system is restarted.
    Programs that use EMS should install their own Ctrl-C handlers and
    critical-error handlers (Ints 23H and 24H) so that they cannot be
    terminated unexpectedly.

    ■ [EMS 4.0] When a handle is released, its name is set to all ASCII nulls.


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Int 67H                                                            [EMS 3.0]
Function 46H (70)
Get version
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Returns the EMS version supported by the expanded memory manager.

Call with:

    AH            = 46H

Returns:

    If function successful

    AH            = 00H
    AL            = version number

    If function unsuccessful

    AH            = error code

Notes:

    ■ The version number is returned in binary code decimal (BCD) format, with
    the integer portion in the upper 4 bits of AL and the fractional portion
    in the lower 4 bits. For example, under an EMM that supports EMS version
    3.2, AL is returned as the value 32H.

    ■ Applications should always check the EMM version number to ensure that
    all of the EMM functions they require are available.


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Int 67H                                                            [EMS 3.0]
Function 47H (71)
Save page map
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Saves the contents of the page-mapping registers on the expanded memory
    hardware, associating those contents with a particular EMM handle.

Call with:

    AH            = 47H
    DX            = EMM handle

Returns:

    If function successful

    AH            = 00H

    If function unsuccessful

    AH            = error code

Notes:

    ■ This function is used by interrupt handlers or device drivers that must
    access expanded memory. The EMM handle supplied to this function is the
    handle that was assigned to the handler or driver during its own
    initialization sequence, not to the program that was interrupted.

    ■ The mapping context is restored by a subsequent call to Int 67H Function
    48H.

    ■ [EMS 4.0] This function saves only the mapping state for the 64 KB page
    frame defined in EMS 3. Programs that are written to take advantage of
    the additional capabilities of EMS 4.0 should use Int 67H Function 4EH
    or 4FH in preference to this function.

Function 48H (72)
Restore page map
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Restores the contents of the page-mapping registers on the expanded memory
    hardware to the values associated with the specified handle by a previous
    call to Int 67H Function 47H.

Call with:

    AH            = 48H

Function 4BH (75)
Get handle count
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Returns the number of active expanded memory handles.

Call with:

    AH            = 4BH

Returns:

    If function successful

    AH            = 00H
    BX            = number of active EMM handles

    If function unsuccessful

    AH            = error code

Notes:

    ■ If the returned number of EMM handles is zero, the expanded memory
    manager is idle, and none of the expanded memory is in use.

    ■ The value returned by this function is not necessarily the same as the
    number of programs using expanded memory because one program may own
    multiple EMM handles.

    ■ The number of active EMM handles never exceeds 255.

Notes:

    ■ The buffer is filled in with a series of DWORD (32-bit) entries, one per
    active EMM handle. The first word of an entry contains the handle, and
    the second word contains the number of pages allocated to that handle.

    ■ The maximum number of active handles is 256 (including the operating
    system handle 0), so a buffer size of 1024 bytes is adequate in all
    cases.

Function 56H (86) Subfunctions 00H and 01H
Map pages and call
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Alters the expanded memory mapping context and performs a far call to the
    specified address. When the destination routine executes a far return, the
    EMM again alters the page-mapping context as instructed and then returns
    control to the original caller.

Call with:

    AH            = 56H
    AL            = subfunction

                    0       = map using physical page numbers

    If function unsuccessful

    AH            = error code

Notes:

    ■ The format of the buffer containing map and call information is:

    0EH           8              reserved (0)
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Both map lists have the same format and consist of a series of
    double-word entries, one per page. The first word of each entry contains
    the logical page number, and the second word contains the physical page
    number or segment (depending on the value in register AL) to which it
    should be mapped.

    ■ A request to map zero pages and call is not an error; the effect is a
    simple far call.

Function 5CH (92)
Prepare Expanded Memory Manager for warm boot
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Prepares the expanded memory hardware for an impending warm boot. This
    function affects the current mapping context, the alternate register set
    in use, and any other expanded memory hardware dependencies that would
    ordinarily be initialized at system boot time.

Call with:

    AH            = 5CH

Returns:

    If function successful

    AH            = 00H

    If function unsuccessful

    AH            = error code

Note:

    ■ If an application maps expanded memory at addresses below 640 KB, the
    application must trap all possible conditions that might lead to a warm
    boot, so that this function can be called first.

Function 5DH (93) Subfunction 00H
Enable EMM operating-system functions
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Enables the operating-system─specific EMM functions (Int 67H Functions
    59H, 5BH, and 5DH) for calls by any program or device driver. (This is
    the default condition.)

Call with:

    AH            = 5DH
    AL            = 00H
    BX:CX         = access key (if not first call to function)

Returns:

    If function successful

    AH            = 00H
    BX:CX         = access key (if first call to function)

    If function unsuccessful

    AH            = error code

Notes:

    ■ An access key is returned in registers BX and CX on the first call to
    Int 67H Function 5DH Subfunction 00H or 01H. The access key is
    required for all subsequent calls to either function.

    ■ This function is intended for use by operating systems only.

Function 5DH (93) Subfunction 01H
Disable EMM operating-system functions
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Disables the operating-system─specific EMM functions (Int 67H Functions
    59H, 5BH, and 5DH) for calls by application programs and device
    drivers, reserving the use of these functions for the operating system.

Call with:

    AH            = 5DH
    AL            = 01H
    BX:CX         = access key (if not first call to function)

Returns:

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Releases the access key obtained by a previous call to Int 67H Function
    5DH Subfunction 00H or 01H.

Call with:

    AH            = 5DH
    AL            = 02H
    BX:CX         = access key

Returns:

    If function successful

    AH            = 00H

    If function unsuccessful

    AH            = error code

Notes:

    ■ With respect to the operating-system─specific expanded memory functions,
    the EMM is returned to the state it had when the system was initialized.
    A new access key is returned by the next call to Int 67H Function 5DH
    Subfunction 00H or 01H.

    ■ This function is intended for use by operating systems only and can be
    disabled by the operating system at any time.
